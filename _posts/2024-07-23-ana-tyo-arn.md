A while back, ANA announced that they were [launching three new direct flights from Europe to Tokyo](https://blog.awardfares.com/ana-new-routes-to-europe/) this winter: Stockholm, Istanbul and Milan to Tokyo. After several back-and-forths and dates postponed, tickets are now on sale, and the best part: **awards are available**. So far we've seen seats using SAS EuroBonus and United MileagePlus.
