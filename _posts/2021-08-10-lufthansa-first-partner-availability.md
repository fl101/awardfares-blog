Historically Lufthansa First class partner award redemptions have only been available 14 days in advance, making it a little difficult to plan trips with them. However, it seems that has now been extended to up to 30 days in advance. We'll have to wait and see whether or not this is a permanent change.

## How many days in advance can you book?

30 days in advance for partner airlines. 180 days in advance for Miles & More members.

## Which routes are available?

Currently Lufthansa is only offering First Class on their 747-8i fleet. As of August, 2021, the following [routes](http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=FRA-EZE,FRA-GRU,FRA-PVG,FRA-DEL,FRA-HND,FRA-MEX,FRA-JNB,FRA-ORD,FRA-LAX,FRA-MIA,FRA-EWR,FRA-SFO) are available:
