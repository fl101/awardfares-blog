SAS Scandinavian Airlines is gearing up to [launch its service to Morocco](https://www.sasgroup.net/newsroom/press-releases/2023/sas-returns-to-africa-by-flying-to-agadir-this-upcoming-winter/) this November, marking its grand return to Africa after a break of many, many years.

They've got their sights set on Agadir-Al Massira Airport, with flights taking off from both Copenhagen Airport and Stockholm Arlanda Airport starting November 4th. These flights will run once a week, seasonally, until March 2024.

The route will be operated by the Airbus A320neo, which can accommodate up to 180 passengers split across two classes.

Agadir, according to SAS, is the perfect place to escape the chilly Scandinavian winter. With its sun-kissed beaches and top-notch golf courses, it's a winter getaway you wouldn't want to miss.

This announcement follows on the heels of SAS's recent reveal that they'll resume their service to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport from Copenhagen, starting Oct. 30. It's been nearly ten years since they last flew that route, making this a pretty big deal!
