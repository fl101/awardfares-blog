Air Canada announced its plan to reintroduce nonstop flights between Vancouver International Airport (YVR) and Singapore's Changi International Airport (SIN), marking a return to the Singapore market after **over 30 years**! The service will start on April 3, 2024, and operate four times weekly using the Boeing 787 fleet.

The great news is that flights are already bookable using Aeroplan miles, and availability is wide open, as shown by AwardFares.

Flights from YVR will depart on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, while return services from SIN will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The schedule is planned to facilitate connections across North America and Southeast Asia through Air Canada's hub at YVR and partner Singapore Airlines at SIN.
