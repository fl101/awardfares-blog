## Why Atlanta?

One of the most compelling reasons for SAS's new route to Atlanta is the anticipated transition of the airline from Star Alliance to SkyTeam. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is a major hub for Delta Air Lines, a leading member of the SkyTeam alliance.

SAS President & CEO Anko van der Werff highlighted the strategic partnership with Delta Air Lines. This collaboration is set to broaden SAS's reach, offering passengers access to numerous destinations across the Southern USA, the Caribbean, and Latin America.

Atlanta is **a significant business hub** in the United States, home to numerous Fortune 500 companies, including Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and UPS. This makes the city a lucrative destination for business travelers, a key demographic for airlines like SAS.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where over 107 million passengers traveled in 2023, stands as the [world’s busiest and most efficient airport](https://simpleflying.com/busiest-airports-usa-2023/). The new route to Atlanta is expected to significantly boost cargo transportation, mainly due to its proximity to the Port of Savannah, America's largest and fastest-growing container terminal.

Atlanta's airport is not only the world's busiest in terms of passenger traffic but also **a major cargo hub**. With the proximity of the Port of Savannah, one of America's largest and fastest-growing container terminals, there is substantial potential for cargo transport alongside passenger services.

## More Summer Routes

The expansion doesn't stop with Atlanta. SAS is also increasing the frequency of its flights to the United States. The Copenhagen-New York (JFK) route will see up to two daily flights, supplementing the existing daily services to New York-Newark Airport from Stockholm, Oslo, and Copenhagen. Additionally, the Copenhagen-Boston route will now operate daily, an increase from its previous six times a week schedule during the summer. Furthermore, Copenhagen to Toronto will benefit from an additional fourth weekly flight.

The upcoming summer program will see SAS serving a diverse range of destinations in North America, including Atlanta, New York (EWR & JFK), Chicago, Boston, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami (until April 7), and Toronto, further cementing its position as a key player in transatlantic travel.

SAS has been actively expanding its global connectivity. In early June 2023, the airline signed a codeshare agreement with EL AL Israel Airlines, which became effective in February. Another significant partnership was with Etihad Airways in October. These codeshare agreements enhance passenger connectivity, providing access to a wide range of destinations worldwide. SAS now boasts 18 such agreements with various carriers globally.
