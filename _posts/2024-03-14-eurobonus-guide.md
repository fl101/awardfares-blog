This year marks a giant leap for Scandinavian Airlines, particularly for SAS EuroBonus members. The airline will be acquired, among others, by Air France-KLM, leaving Star Alliance in Q2 2024 and joining SkyTeam immediately! (recently confirmed during a press statement.) This means the game for frequent travelers will change very soon: award flights you can redeem using SAS EuroBonus points will be different forever.

**How to prepare for the transition?** Don't worry—we've got you covered. That's why we prepared this post as the Ultimate Guide to Using SAS EuroBonus Points. The intention is to help you find the best (free) flights on SAS and Star Alliance before the airline leaves and, ultimately, on SkyTeam partners once the airline enters the new alliance and integrates with those partners.

  TIME UNTIL Q2
</div>

## Thoughts and Wild Guesses

There have yet to be any official announcements about how the EuroBonus program will change once the acquisition occurs. While there is one scenario in which EuroBonus shuts down and Flying Blue becomes SAS's new official loyalty program, the conditions for that to happen are far from being met. If so, it won't be on the 2024 horizon.

Instead, from a technical standpoint, it makes more sense that the airline(s) take more gradual steps until new changes are implemented. Here are some of our thoughts on different areas from our humble perspective as technologists and experience as travelers.

### EuroBonus Award Chart

The award charts show how many points you need for a free flight. On SAS flights, the airline may adjust the numbers (bumping them up), making flights cost more. These devaluations are easy to do and typically happen on short notice (effective the month after or so).

As of today, the table below shows how many EuroBonus points you would need for a one-way flight with SAS and Widerøe, excluding taxes and fees.

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/eb-award-chart-sas.webp" alt="EuroBonus Award Chart on SAS (2024)." />

The Star Alliance part of the chart will be removed immediately, as redemptions will be stopped right away. A new chart for redemptions on SkyTeam partners should come simultaneously or soon, depending on how fast they implement redemptions on those partners.

The table below shows how many EuroBonus points you would need for a round trip flight on Star Alliance airlines as of today, excluding taxes and carrier-imposed fees. The price in points depends on your destination and travel class.

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/eb-award-chart-europe.webp" alt="EuroBonus Award Chart on Star Alliance (Ending in Q2, 2024)." />

*You can check the full chart and [all other to/from combinations beyond Europe here](https://www.flysas.com/en/eurobonus/points/fly-with-points/star-alliance-point-chart/).*

The EuroBonus [award chart is zone-based](https://blog.awardfares.com/demystifying-award-charts/), and this aspect is unlikely to change during 2024. While most programs are shifting to dynamic pricing, airlines typically announce significant changes like these with 4-6 months of notice to their members. Mainly to avoid screwing up Elite Status qualification windows and to have more time for planning.

[Flying Blue (Air France-KLM)](https://blog.awardfares.com/introducing-flying-blue/) adopted dynamic pricing recently, so it's likely that if EuroBonus is kept as a separate program, it will follow along.

### Earning EuroBonus Points

**On SAS**: No changes in the short term.

**On Star Alliance Partners**: Be prepared to stop accruing points for flights on Star Alliance airlines taken as soon as the new agreement with SkyTeam becomes effective.

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/earn-sas-partners.webp" alt="Earning EuroBonus points on Star Alliance Flights will stop by Q2." />

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/earn-sas-partners-airlines.webp" alt="Earning EuroBonus points on Star Alliance Flights will stop by Q2." />

**On SkyTeam Partners**: In an ideal scenario, once SAS is officially part of SkyTeam, it is possible to earn points on partners' flights right away. Hold on, it could be more straightforward. Implementing accrual and redemptions takes time, months, and sometimes even years.

We have already seen some integration between SAS and Delta when booking revenue tickets so that the changes might happen sooner for significant partners such as DL, Air France, and KLM.

### EuroBonus Award Search Portal

**For SAS Flights**: Probably the same in the beginning. Same as we know already.

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/eb-portal-sas.webp" alt="EuroBonus Search Portal for Award Flights on SAS (2024)." />

**For Redemptions on Star Alliance**: These will be turned off immediately after SAS joins SkyTeam. Members will no longer be able to search and redeem for flights on Lufthansa, ANA,

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/eb-portal-sa.webp" alt="EuroBonus Search Portal for Award Flights on Star Alliance. Will disappear on Q2, 2024." />

**For Redemptions on SkyTeam Partners**: Not at launch, but we have hopes that some portal will appear for SkyTeam flights during Q2-Q3, at least for a handful of partners.

### Amex 2-for-1 Vouchers / Companion Tickets

For residents of Norway and Sweden and cardholders of the SAS American Express Elite card, one question remains: how does the transition impact the 2-for-1 vouchers also valid on Star Alliance flights?

The wording on the American Express website remains unchanged (until more details are known).

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/amex-voucher.webp" alt="SAS Amex Elite 2 for 1 vouchers will stop working for Star Alliance. Will they work for SkyTeam?." />

It's safer to assume that vouchers will only be usable on SAS flights from the moment it join SkyTeam. As we said earlier, it's unclear if/when redemptions on SkyTeam partners will become available and whether the vouchers will be usable on those or not.

If you have unused vouchers and are looking into flying with Star Alliance Airlines, this might be a good time to consolidate bookings. For example, it might be a good time to try cabins such as Lufthansa First, ANA The Room, etc.

## How To Find Cheap EuroBonus Award Flights (Step-by-step)

### Booking flights on SAS

#### 1. Go to [AwardFares](https://awardfares.com/signup)

Creating an account is optional, but it's also free, and it gives you access to more features. Make sure to [sign up for one here](https://awardfares.com/signup).

#### 2. Select **EuroBonus** as the Frequent Flyer Program

Tap on the **Loyalty Program** field and select SAS EuroBonus

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/ffp-eb.webp" alt="Select EuroBonus as Frequent Flyer Program in AwardFares." />

#### 3. Under *Airlines*, select **SAS only**

From now on, you will only see available award seats operated by SAS on the results list.

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/airline-sas.webp" alt="Select SAS as under Airlines to show bonus trips on SAS only." />

#### 4. Add a Route

In the **Origin** and **Destination** fields, add one or more airports to search for flights between those locations. AwardFares will search for award flights regardless of the number of stops. You can use the **Stops** filter to only search for direct/non-stop flights.

In the example below, we search for flights [between Copenhagen and New York](https://awardfares.com/search?CPH.area:NYC.;a:SK;z:sas). Note that we use the metropolitan area codes **NYC** to get results to and from any airport in New York (JFK, EWR, LGA).

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/route-sas.webp" alt="Select EuroBonus as Frequent Flyer Program in AwardFares." />

#### 4. Explore dates

If you have a particular date in mind, add it by tapping on the **Calendar** field.

Alternatively, you can use AwardFares **Timeline View** to explore the seat availability on different dates. The Timeline View displays how many seats are available for each day of the week/month. The bars are color-coded, so it's easy to distinguish between cabin classes (Economy, Business, First). You can also trigger new searches by tapping the refresh icon underneath each day.

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/results-sas.webp" alt="EuroBonus Results in AwardFares." />

In addition, you can also tap anywhere on the flight to display more details in an expanded view, such as aircraft type, and even [get the current seat maps](https://blog.awardfares.com/seatmaps-guide/) to see which seats are free versus occupied!

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/details.webp" alt="EuroBonus award flight details." />

#### 5. Sort by Price or Stops

Whether you are exploring dates using the Timeline View or have selected a specific day, AwardFares will show you the available seats (with real-time data) within seconds in the result list below.

You can tap on the different header columns to sort the results by price. Use the **Eco**, **Prem**, **Biz**, and **First** class tags to find cheap awards across multiple dates, itineraries, and airlines.

<img src="../assets/img/eurobonus-guide/sort-by-price-sas.gif" alt="Sorting EuroBonus Award Flights by Price in AwardFares" />

You can also tap on the **Stops** header to display the shortest trips first (among similarly priced flights)

### 6. Book on the SAS EuroBonus Portal

Once you have identified the flights you want (or built an itinerary using our [Journey Planner](https://blog.awardfares.com/journey-planner/)), go to the airline's website and make the booking.


### Book on Star Alliance partner

##### Cheapest Award Flights in SAS Go (Economy)

In this case, we want to understand the cheapest days to fly in Economy Class using United MileagePlus miles from New York to London.

With the Timeline View, we see there are plenty of available seats. We tap on the **Eco** column and sort award fights by price in Economy Class.

AwardFares will show you all available seats sorted by price, and then by date.

<img src="../assets/img/cheap-award-flights/sort-by-price-eco.webp" alt="How to find cheaps award flight using AwardFares." />

As we see, the cheapest flights start on November 9th, with multiple options. You can tap the anywhere on the flight to show the detailed view.

In this case, we see that a *saver* award in Economy is just 21.7k miles plus USD 5.6 in taxes, and there are over nine seats available.

<img src="../assets/img/cheap-award-flights/sort-by-price-eco-details.webp" alt="How to find cheaps award flight using AwardFares." />

Similarly, you can explore other options (nonstop and with stopovers) going back to the result list.

##### Cheapest Award Flights in SAS Plus

Similarly, you can explore other options (nonstop and with stopovers) by returning to the result list.

We can repeat the process but now tap on the **Prem** column. Now, AwardFares will sort results based on the prices for the Premium Economy cabin.

As we can see, this cabin's cheapest options start on October 18th. All the options include at least one stopover, and most itineraries are mixed-cabin (which means there is at least one segment in another cabin, such as Economy).

By skimming through the results, you can quickly identify the most convenient options at this price point (50k miles).

You can also keep scrolling to find more dates or use the filters to exclude mixed cabin itineraries.

<img src="../assets/img/cheap-award-flights/sort-by-price-prem.webp" alt="How to find cheaps award flight using AwardFares." />

##### Cheapest Award Flights in Business Class

Similarly, by tapping the **Biz** header, flights will be sorted by price in the Business Class cabin. In this case, we see plenty of seats at this price point (80k miles) almost daily.

<img src="../assets/img/cheap-award-flights/sort-by-price-biz.webp" alt="How to find cheaps award flight using AwardFares." />

### 6. Book on the SAS EuroBonus Portal

Once you have identified the flights you want (or built an itinerary using our Journey Planner), go to the airline's website and make the booking. Remember that some of these itineraries are not bookable online for specific programs (e.g., mixed-cabin awards on SAS EuroBonus). In those situations, you will need to call their service center.



## How To Determine If You Are Getting A Good Redemption?

Traveling on award flights is a rewarding experience, but not all redemptions are the same, particularly with most programs switching to dynamic award charts. Some offer significantly better value than others.

So, how can you be sure you're getting a good deal with your hard-earned miles or points? Here are a few things to remember that will help you determine the worthiness of an award flight redemption.

### The Cent-Per-Mile (CPM) Calculation

To determine if you're getting good value, you can use the CPM calculation:

**CPM** = (Cash Price of Ticket - Taxes and Fees) / Number of Miles Used

The same applies if your program uses points instead of miles (1 mile/point). For example, if a flight costs $500 or 25,000 miles plus $50 in taxes and fees, the calculation would be:

CPM = ($500 - $50) / 25,000 = 1.8 cents per mile

Generally, a CPM above 1.5 cents (USD/EUR) in Economy Class and higher in premium cabins is considered good, but this can vary by airline and route. It also varies depending on your currency.

But beyond the absolute value, you can use this metric to compare different redemptions within the same program. If you are getting a 0.3 cent per point value on a fight between Stockholm and Frankfurt but a 1.1 cent per point on a flight from Stockholm to Miami, it might be better to aim for the latter one, even if you need to rack up more points unless they expire soon, of course.

### Quick CPM Calculator

Use the mini tool below to calculate the CPM of your award flight. You can enter the price in any currency ($/€/£/SEK/NOK/DKK).

<div class="calculator">
    <label for="cashPrice">Cash Price of Ticket ($/€...): </label>
    <input type="number" id="cashPrice" placeholder="e.g., 500">
    <br><br>
    <label for="taxesFees">Taxes and Fees: </label>
    <input type="number" id="taxesFees" placeholder="e.g., 50">
    <br><br>
    <label for="milesUsed">Number of Miles/Points Used: </label>
    <input type="number" id="milesUsed" placeholder="e.g., 25000">
    <br><br>
    <button class="btn" onclick="calculateCPM()">Calculate CPM</button>
    <br><br>
    <label for="result">CPM (cents-per-mile/point): </label>
    <input type="text" id="result" readonly>
</div>

### Consider the Cash Price

Before redeeming miles, always check the cash price of the same ticket. If it's low, paying cash and earning miles on that flight might be more economical, saving your accumulated miles for a pricier ticket in the future. This strategy can also be an excellent option to help you earn points faster and qualify for elite status, getting better benefits in the long run.

### Recognize the Value of Premium Redemptions

Using miles for premium cabins such as First and Business Class can often provide higher value, especially for long-haul flights. While the miles required might be significantly more, the experience, comfort, and amenities can make it worth it.

Airlines tend to have aggressive deals and discounted fares for Economy Class tickets and less for premium cabins. This means you will likely get a higher CPM value on premium cabin flights and a better return.

Of course, it ultimately depends on what kind of travel you want (short or long haul), which destinations, and your travel group (solo, couple, family, etc.).

### Beware of High Taxes and Surcharges

Some airlines have hefty fuel surcharges on award tickets, which can diminish the value of your redemption. Always calculate the total cost, including fees, to determine the true value.

**Always check** and compare the same route served by different airlines. Onboard service and the experience you get are one thing to evaluate (some airlines have better planes, cabins, and service than others), but they can also charge heavy fees and surcharges.

For example, the route from Frankfurt to Los Angeles is served by Lufthansa, American, and United, but United charges $12 in fees to book the award, while Lufthansa charges $136. That's a 10x difference!

### Compare Across Loyalty Programs

The same flight can be available in more than one program! For example, you could book the same seat using Aeroplan Miles or SAS EuroBonus points while having different prices. Before booking, check which program has the same price and evaluate if you can book.

This trick only works if you collect points in multiple programs, or if your points are transferrable. For example, a ton of credit cards (like American Express) allow you to send your points to a specific program.

With AwardFares, comparing the prices in different programs is extremely simple. Simply click on the **Expand** icon (+), and you'll see if the seat is available in other programs and for how much.

### Understand Seasonality and Demand

Awards during peak travel times require more miles. Travel during off-peak seasons for better availability and value.

Some programs offer different rates for high and low seasons, and they call it **saver** and **non-saver**. AwardFares shows this information clearly in the detailed view.

<img src="../assets/img/prices-and-mixed-cabins/saver-vs-nonsaver.webp" alt="AwardFares Award Flight Search Engine With Flight Prices." />

### Set Up Alerts

AwardFares can help you monitor and find the best award flight opportunities. Setting up alerts ensures you're informed via email as soon as a good redemption pops up. We have [a full tutorial here](https://blog.awardfares.com/alerts/).

We are already working on feature requests, such as price-based alerts, so you only get a notification when a given seat becomes available at a certain price point. Stay tuned to our updates, and make sure to [subscribe to our newsletter](https://awardfares.com/newsletter) to get all the latest information!

### Remember the Intangible Value

While the CPM calculation is handy, sometimes the value of an award booking is more personal. It could be the ability to attend a special family event or a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Not all good redemptions can be measured in cents per mile.

Determining the value of an award flight isn't solely about mathematics; it's also about personal value and the experiences that travel brings. Always weigh the quantitative and qualitative aspects to choose your travel needs and wishes best.
