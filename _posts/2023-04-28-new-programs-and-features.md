We're thrilled to announce the rollout of some great new features that we know you're going to love! As we continue to innovate and improve our platform, we had the chance to incorporate some of your feedback in this new version of AwardFares. 

1. [Two New Frequent Flyer Programs](#new-providers-american-and-alaska)
2. [Area Search](#area-search)
3. [Improved Frequent Flyer Program Picker](#improved-frequent-flyer-program-picker)
4. [First Class Search With SAS EuroBonus](#first-class-search-with-sas-eurobonus)


## New Providers: American and Alaska

This is a big one. AwardFares now supports [American AAdvantage](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:aadvantage) and [Alaska MileagePlan](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:alaska) programs! Users can perform searches under both programs by simply selecting them on the (now improved) FFP picker.

Both programs are now visible on the availability view after performing a search. Just click on a flight to see more details on the available seats for each class and program.

## Area Search

This is a long-awaited feature: users can now search metropolitan areas! For example, you can query flights to [TYO](https://awardfares.com/search?.area:TYO.), [LON](https://awardfares.com/search?.area:LON.), [NYC](https://awardfares.com/search?.area:NYC.), and AwardFares will show up results for airports in that metro area. Click to try!

## Improved Frequent Flyer Program Picker

The Frequent Flyer Program (FFP) field is now a primary search field, which makes it easier to interact with an more clear when performing searches, as we grow into more frequent flyer programs. Users can still perform searches across program, just as before, by tapping on the drop-down menu and adding those.

The FFP selection is required, unless performing a broad search (e.g. [Europe-Asia](https://awardfares.com/search?zone:Europe.continent:AS.)). By the way, AwardFares will remember your selection for your next session, so there’s no need to re-select the programs on new sessions.

Gold members can search **up to two programs** at a time, and **unlimited** programs for Diamond members.

## Bonus: First-class Search With SAS EuroBonus

Determining [first-class availability on SAS EuroBonus](https://awardfares.com/search?..;c:first;z:eurobonus) has always been challenging, and most often it requires to give a call to SAS service center. BUT, we’ve now improved the experience for EuroBonus members.

Searches on a first-class route that can be booked using SAS EuroBonus now also add a search a search on Aeroplan too. Historically, Aeroplan’s availability matches fairly well with EuroBonus, so we use this information to complement SAS search results.
