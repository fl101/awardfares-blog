## What is Flying Blue?

Flying Blue is the loyalty program of Air France-KLM, one of the world's largest airline groups, including several other airline partners. Launched in June 2005 and born from the merger of Air France's and KLM's previous loyalty schemes, Flying Blue offers features like earning miles based on the amount spent on tickets, a wide range of redemption options, and periodic **Promo Rewards** (or *Promo Awards*). Members of Flying Blue can redeem their accumulated miles for flight tickets, upgrades, extra baggage allowance, and other services. The program features different membership tiers, starting from Explorer and moving up to Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Ultimate, each offering progressively more benefits, including priority boarding, lounge access, and increased mileage accrual.
