## Why Velocity?

[**Virgin Australia Velocity**](https://www.velocityfrequentflyer.com/) is the frequent flyer program for Virgin Australia. It is a solid loyalty program for frequent flyers based in Australia, New Zealand, and others. Here's the rundown:

* **Earning**: Collect Velocity Points on Virgin Australia flights and a bunch of partner airlines (including Singapore Airlines and United as of recently). Transferring points from partner rewards programs like Citi Rewards and American Express Membership Rewards can be a great way to boost your balance quickly.
* **Redeeming**: Use your points for reward seats, upgrades, or even grab "Any Seat" award flights on Virgin Australia and many partners. For the best redemption value, consider premium cabin flights on Virgin Australia or partner airlines like Singapore Airlines and Etihad Airways.
* **Partners**: Their network extends beyond Virgin Australia with over 70 program partners, offering opportunities to earn and redeem points across airlines and other travel options.
* **Status**: Climb the tiers (Silver, Gold, Platinum) for perks like lounge access, priority boarding, and extra baggage allowance - similar to other frequent flyer programs.
* **Family Pooling**: A unique benefit that allows families to combine points and status credits, making it easier to reach higher tiers.

## Understanding Virgin Australia Velocity Award Chart

Virgin Australia's Velocity Frequent Flyer program uses a **distance-based award chart** ([read more about award charts here](https://blog.awardfares.com/demystifying-award-charts/)). Each destination is classified into a specific zone, and the points required for a flight depend on the zones you are traveling between, and the different cabin classes (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, etc).

Here is a breakdown of the key zones:

- Zone 1: Australia (short-haul)
- Zone 2: Australia (long-haul)
- Zone 3: New Zealand, South Pacific
- Zone 4: Southeast Asia
- Zone 5: North Asia
- Zone 6: Middle East
- Zone 7: Europe
- Zone 8: North America

The award chart offers points rates for both one-way and return trips. You can use your Velocity points to book flights not only on Virgin Australia but also on partner airlines like Singapore Airlines, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, United Airlines, Air Canada, and others. Keep in mind that additional carrier charges may apply to reward flights, varying depending on the operating airline and distance traveled. If you don't have enough points for a full award, the program also has a Points+Pay option, where you can use a combination of points and cash to book your ticket.
