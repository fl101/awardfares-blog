## From an existing search

Another simple way to set up an alert is from the search view. While you are performing a search, and once you have set up a route, date and filters, you will see a **Track** button in the interface.

When you tap on it, you will see a toggle that will add an alert preserving your existing configuration and filters.

Simple, huh?

Once you tap on that toggle, you will be able to see the alert in your dashboard, where you can edit it, copy or even remove it.

### Edit an alert

You can adjust your alerts at any time very easily by clicking on the **Edit** (pencil) icon on your **Alerts** dashboard.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/img/alerts/edit-alert.webp" />
</figure>


### Duplicate an alert

You can use the **Copy** icon right next to the **Edit** icon to duplicate the alert. A new popup window will appear with the same configuration, where you can change and adjust each of the fields. Once you are done, you can use the **Save** button to add the new alert.

Duplicating alerts is useful when you are interested in tracking similar flights without having to enter all the fields from scratch. For example, you could set up the same route but for different dates, number of passengers, stops, or cabins.

### Trigger a search

Each alert in the dashboard also has a **Search** icon. When you tap on this option, it will trigger a new search window in AwardFares and start a new search with the filters and configuration set up in the alert.

This is a quick way to trigger searches for the flights you are interested.

### Delete an alert

You can also delete your alerts if you're no longer interested in them. By clicking on the trash icon you can delet alerts individually. Alternatively, you can tap on **Remove all alerts** to delete all of them at once.

## More Tips

* You can create multiple alerts for different routes and dates. This is a great way to stay on top of award availability for all of your dream trips.
* You can set up a "wide alert" to check for availability on three days with a single alert. This is a good option if you're flexible on your travel dates.
* You can filter your alerts by cabin class, airlines, number of passengers, and number of stops. This way, you can only be notified about award availability that meets your specific criteria.
* You can also set up alerts for specific award programs. This is a great way to track award availability for your favorite programs.


## Alerts FAQ


### How many alerts can I configure?

The number of alerts you can have simultanoeusly depends on your AwardFares tier. The Gold tier lets you have 5 alerts at a time, while the Diamon tier lets you have unlimited alerts. The Free tier does not currently not support alerts.
 
### How soon can I expect a notification after I set up an alert?

As soon as the airline or frequent flyer program opens award seats on the route and configuration you have set up in the alert, AwardFares will send you an email. Searches for alerts run daily, so keep in mind that it can take up to 24h from the moment the airline releases the award seats until AwardFares detects them and notifies you.

### How often does AwardFares search for my alerts?

Alerts are searched once a day.

### I set up an alert but never received an email from AwardFares

This means that the airline or frequent flyer program didn't release award seats for the route and configuration you are looking for.

### Does AwardFares automatically remove my existing alerts if the flight date has passed?

No. We don't remove any alert automatically, as you might want to keep the configuration to edit or duplicate.

### Can I configure a metro area in my alert?

The current implementation only supports specific airports when setting departure and destination cities. However, we are working on supporting metro areas in the same alert, and this feature will be released in the upcoming weeks.

### Can I add multiple frequent flyer programs in the same alert?

Yes. Simply tick on the programs you are interested when configuring the alert.

### I deleted an alert accidentally. Can I undo it?

No. You will need to set up the alert again. Note that deleting an alert is a two-step process and you should always get a confirmation screen or popup to confirm the deletion.
