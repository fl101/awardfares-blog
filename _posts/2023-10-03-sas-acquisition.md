### Major investments in SAS

The consortium will invest a whopping USD 1,175 million into SAS. Out of this, USD 475 million will be directed towards equity, while USD 700 million will be convertible debt. Not stopping at this, Castlelake is also stepping in to refinance SAS’s current loan, offering a new USD 500 million loan.

### Alliance Shakeup

In a strategic move, SAS has decided to join the SkyTeam Alliance, which will result in its exit from the Star Alliance. This transition, however, is subject to approvals.


### Commercial Cooperation

Beyond financial reshuffling, SAS has its eyes set on fortifying its commercial ties with Air France-KLM. This partnership aims to augment connectivity and service offerings for Scandinavian travelers.


### Are you a shareholder?

Once the reorganization is complete, Castlelake will emerge as the holder of the majority of equity and debt. They will be followed by the Danish State, Air France-KLM, and Lind Invest in the stakeholder hierarchy. A portion of the equity will also be allocated to specific creditors.

There are substantial changes on the horizon for 
SAS AB’s stakeholders. By 2024, the company anticipates that all of its common shares and listed commercial hybrid bonds will be canceled and delisted. Current shareholders might not receive any value from this transition, whereas commercial hybrid bond holders could receive a nominal return.

### Leadership Insights

Carsten Dilling, the Chairman of SAS, is optimistic about this transformation. Anko van der Werff, CEO of SAS, believes that this partnership with SkyTeam reaffirms SAS's robust position in the airline industry. Stakeholders, including representatives from Castlelake, Air France-KLM, and Lind Invest, have all voiced their positive outlook on this collaboration and what lies ahead for SAS.

### Moving Ahead

Despite these changes, SAS assures that its operations will remain unaffected, promising uninterrupted service to its loyal customers.
