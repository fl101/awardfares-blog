## SAS Acquisition by Air France-KLM: What You Need To Know

### Major investments in SAS

The consortium will invest a whopping USD 1,175 million into SAS. Out of this, USD 475 million will be directed towards equity, while USD 700 million will be convertible debt. Not stopping at this, Castlelake is also stepping in to refinance SAS’s current loan, offering a new USD 500 million loan.

### Alliance Shakeup

In a strategic move, SAS has decided to join the SkyTeam Alliance, which will result in its exit from the Star Alliance. This transition, however, is subject to approvals.

### Commercial Cooperation

Beyond financial reshuffling, SAS has its eyes set on fortifying its commercial ties with Air France-KLM. This partnership aims to augment connectivity and service offerings for Scandinavian travelers.

### Are you a shareholder?

Once the reorganization is complete, Castlelake will emerge as the holder of the majority of equity and debt. They will be followed by the Danish State, Air France-KLM, and Lind Invest in the stakeholder hierarchy. A portion of the equity will also be allocated to specific creditors.

There are substantial changes on the horizon for 
SAS AB’s stakeholders. By 2024, the company anticipates that all of its common shares and listed commercial hybrid bonds will be canceled and delisted. Current shareholders might not receive any value from this transition, whereas commercial hybrid bond holders could receive a nominal return.

### Leadership Insights

Carsten Dilling, the Chairman of SAS, is optimistic about this transformation. Anko van der Werff, CEO of SAS, believes that this partnership with SkyTeam reaffirms SAS's robust position in the airline industry. Stakeholders, including representatives from Castlelake, Air France-KLM, and Lind Invest, have all voiced their positive outlook on this collaboration and what lies ahead for SAS.

### Moving Ahead

Despite these changes, SAS assures that its operations will remain unaffected, promising uninterrupted service to its loyal customers.

### 5. Get Familiar With Air France, KLM, and SkyTeam

As SAS confirmed their plans to join SkyTeam, this is the best time to familiarize yourself with the new alliance, its airlines, benefits, and routes.

SkyTeam is one of the three major airline alliances in the world. It has 19 member airlines, which fly to over 1,150 destinations in 175 countries.

In addition to general benefits, SkyTeam also offers a number of specific benefits to its passengers, such as:

### 6. Join Online Communities

Engage with other members on platforms like FlyerTalk or airline-specific forums. These communities can be a wealth of information, providing real-time updates, strategies, and shared experiences.

### 7. Monitor External Partnerships

Keep an eye on external partners like hotels, car rentals, or credit card companies aligned with EuroBonus. Changes with the airline might lead to shifts in these partnerships, which could impact your points earning or redemption capabilities.

### 8. Feedback Matters

Should you have concerns, questions, or feedback about the changes, reach out to SAS. Your perspective as a loyal customer is valuable, and airlines often take such feedback into account when shaping their programs.
 
### 9. Explore Status Match Opportunities

Many airline loyalty programs offer status matches to attract elite members from competing airlines. If SAS's changes affect your loyalty benefits, look into shifting your allegiance to another program that will match your current status.

### 10. Be Flexible and Patient

Transitions of this scale are massive undertakings, and there might be hiccups along the way. It's crucial to be patient, flexible, and understanding during this period. Customer service lines might be busier than usual, and some processes might take longer. **Patience is key**.

## Impact on EuroBonus (SAS FAQ)

So far, the conclusion is that for now the EuroBonus program remains unchanged. These are the questions covered.

When SAS eventually joins SkyTeam, you will also be able to enjoy similar status benefits across the extensive SkyTeam network.

- **What about other Star Alliance partner members flying on SAS?** While SAS remains part of Star Alliance, members of other Star Alliance member programs will keep their status benefits while flying on SAS, and will be able to spend their miles/points on SAS flights.

## See The Bright Side

If you take a look online to what the community is discussing on Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and other platforms, it's clear that the news haven't been well received among EuroBonus members and loyal SAS customers. There are several concerns, for example, about what the Lifetime Gold benefits will mean going forward, if SAS will ditch EuroBonus for [FlyingBlue](https://www.flyingblue.com), and complaints that SkyTeam is not as good as other alliances.

While these changes might initially upset people, our advice is to stay positive and embrace change. There are usually many new opportunities and good news during these transitions too, including chances to visit new places, new earning opportunities, and unlocking new award flights.
