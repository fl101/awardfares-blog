On a recent trip between Taipei and Tokyo I had to make a last-minute flight booking. There are many airlines to choose from on this route, with Japanese airlines like ANA and JAL, as well as Taiwanese carriers like EVA Air, China Airlines and STARLUX. Unfortunately STARLUX tickets are usually much more expensive, but on this occasion the prices were roughly the same so it was a perfect time to finally get to try STARLUX. The narrow-body A321neo was the cheapest option, but STARLUX actually operates all of their different aircraft types on this route, which includes A350 and A330-300neo as well.

## INSIGHTER Priority Check-In

When STARLUX first launched, they offered a status matching program between various airlines. I was able to use my BA Gold status to match with [STARLUX's highest tier, INSIGHTER](https://www.starlux-airlines.com/en-TW/cosmile/cosmile-plan/tier-privileges). I've had it for a while now, but this was finally the first time I was able to put it to use.

Ny journey started 4 hours prior to departure at Taoyuan International airport's Terminal 1. Despite arriving quite early, check-in was already open and I was able to drop my luggage before heading down to the land-side food court for some lunch.

## GALACTIC Lounge

Once through security and immigration I headed to the lounge, which I was invited to use thanks to my INSIGHTER status.

I really like the STARLUX space-themed branding, and the design is fantastic as well. Despite being such a new airline, they have their own dedicated lounge at TPE. It looks great, but it is small, really small. The lounge doesn't even have restrooms inside, so you'll have to walk outside to find the nearest restrooms (which doesn't feel particularly premium).

The offerings at the lounge are really good though. There's a small a la carte menu offering breakfast options, as well as lunch/dinner options. The buffet selection was really nice as well, with plenty of beverage options, cakes, desserts, tea, coffee, and spirits.

The staff in the lounge was very friendly and attentive. If it wasn't for the small space and the lack of restrooms, this would be a 5 star lounge!

## Bus-Gate Boarding

Unfortunately today's flight turned out to be a bus-gate departure (a bit of a rare experience at Far East Asian airports). Because T1 at TPE is quite small and cramped, it seems like most narrow body departures use bus-gates.

At least we were already informed at check-in that it would be a bus gate, and the check-in agent told us it was *"very far"* from the lounge. In reality it was only around a 10 min walk from the lounge.

The bus-gate departure area was crowded and rather disorganized (due to the lack of space). Thankfully due to my INSIGHTER status I was able to board in Zone 1, which to my surprise turned out to have a dedicated Starlux-branded shuttle bus exclusively for business and status passengers, which felt very premium.

## The STARLUX Cabin

The STARLUX A321neo cabin looks very smart. The first 2 rows offer a dedicated business class section with 2-2 seating. The remaining 29 rows in economy are 3-3. I would love to try the STARLUX business class sometime, but in this case I was sitting near the back of the plane.

Upon entering the aircraft, the cabin crew welcomed me abroad and swiftly personally escorted me all the way back to my seat on row 30. A few minutes later another flight attendant came to welcome me onbroad, greeting me by my full name, and explained that they had prepared slippers and a blanket for me (I guess this is one of the small perks you get as an INSIGHTER member).

The economy seats felt spacious, well-designed, and were really comfortable. Every seat also came with a large (and very responsive) IFE, featuring a large selection of movies, entertainment, maps, shopping, and even food/beverage menus.

A full meal was served on this flight, as well as a large selection of drinks, including alcoholic beverages, like wine, spirits and even a signature cocktail.

The food was really good, however, despite working efficiently, it took a long time to receive my meal near the back of the plane. But I can't fault the crew for this, since I can understand it takes time for them to serve a meal and beverage to nearly 200 passengers.

## Summary

Overall it was a great short-haul flight. However, if I was choosing between STARLUX and EVA Air or China Airlines, I would just choose the cheapest option, and wouldn't go out of my way choosing STARLUX. I'm really looking forward to hopefully trying one of their wide-body jets or Business class some time in the near future!
