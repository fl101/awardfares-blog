Delta Air Lines [just announced](https://news.delta.com/delta-fly-taipei-seattle-hub) that it will enhance its Asian network by introducing a daily direct flight from [Seattle (SEA) to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE)](https://awardfares.com/search?SEA.TPE.2024-06-06;o:duration;so:a;z:delta), starting June 6, 2024, subject to government approval. This route marks a significant milestone as Delta's first nonstop flight from the U.S. to Taipei and signifies the airline's return to TPE since its last operation through Narita in 2017.

## 90 Years of History and Growth

2023 marks Delta's 90th anniversary in Seattle, tracing back to Northwest Airways' operations in 1933. Delta's journey in Seattle began in 1980, and today, the airline boasts over 160 daily departures to 50 global destinations from SEA. The introduction of the Taipei service further solidifies Seattle's role as a vital gateway for Delta's operations across the Pacific. This addition to Delta's trans-Pacific portfolio is expected to boost both business and leisure travel, reinforcing Seattle's status as a key international hub.

## Extensive Network Growth

Delta's expansion isn't limited to Seattle. In 2023, the airline has significantly increased its presence across Asia and the Pacific. This includes additional flights to ICN from ATL, expanded services to China, resumed flights to HND, and new routes like the LAX to Auckland service. These strategic moves demonstrate Delta's commitment to offering comprehensive connectivity in the region.
