## How To Find Good AAdvantage Redemptions?

**Be flexible with your travel dates**. 

Award availability is often more limited on peak travel dates, so you may be able to find better deals if you are able to travel during the off-season.

**Consider flying on partner airlines**. 

American Airlines has a number of partner airlines that you can use to redeem your miles for flights. This gives you access to a wider range of destinations and airlines than you would if you were only able to book flights on American Airlines.

**Use a tool like AwardFares to search for award availability**.

AwardFares is a website that allows you to search for award availability on multiple frequent flyer programs at once. This makes it easy to find award flights that are not available on the website of a single program.

**Sign up for American Airlines' email alerts**.

American Airlines offers email alerts that will notify you when award availability opens up on specific routes. This is a great way to be the first to know about new award opportunities.

## American Airlines Cabin Classes

Cabin classes on American Airlines can be a bit confusing, especially when booking awards seats. Their Flagship First can feel like Business Class, and they have Main Cabin Extra (Economy), which is **NOT THE SAME** as Basic Economy.

Here’s a quick summary of what you get on each class when booking a pure AAdvantage award on American Airlines:

* [First-class](https://awardfares.com/search?..;c:first;o:price;so:asc;z:aadvantage) (a.k.a Flagship First):
    * Lie-flat seats
    * Plenty of space and privacy
    * Premium meals and drinks
    * Access to the Flagship Lounge
    * Priority boarding
* [Business class](https://awardfares.com/search?..;c:business;o:price;so:asc;z:aadvantage):
    * Lie-flat seats
    * Plenty of space and privacy
    * Premium meals and drinks
    * Access to the Flagship Lounge
    * Priority boarding
* [Premium Economy](https://awardfares.com/search?..;c:premeco;o:price;so:asc;z:aadvantage):
    * Wider seats
    * More legroom
    * Premium meals and drinks
    * Priority boarding
* [Main Cabin Extra](https://awardfares.com/search?..;c:economy;o:price;so:asc;z:aadvantage):
    * More legroom
    * Free snacks and drinks
    * Priority boarding

When searching on AwardFares, both Main Cabin (Basic Economy) and Main Cabin Extra are displayed as **Economy**, so make sure to check the award ticket detailed condition on American Airlines' website before confirming the booking. 

If you are flying on partner airlines, then the cabin classes are different and you might need to check the partner airline's website. When booking an AAdvantage award on partner airlines (British Airways, Iberia, Cathay Pacific, etc.) the cabins will be First, Business and Economy.
