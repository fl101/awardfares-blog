Heja EuroBonus members! If you have *just a few* points on your account and are unsure what to do with them, this is a great time to book a winter escape at great rates. The program is offering a 25% discount on [SAS Go and SAS Plus](https://flysas.com/) award trips to selected destinations in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.

Hurry up, because there's only a few days left to book! The promotion is valid until November 20th for flights between December and March 2024. The offer applies to one-way and return journeys in SAS Go Bonus and SAS Plus Bonus. And as usual, children 2-11 years old get 50% of the point price, even on the already discounted price.

There are many seats available, as we show below using AwardFares. Typical [prices for these awards](https://www.flysas.com/en/eurobonus/points/fly-with-points/point-chart/) are 5k EuroBonus points in SAS Go and 10k in SAS Plus (one-way). However, with this promotion, you can get them for as low as 3750 points and 7500 points respectively.

In addition, members with the SAS Mastercard Fly Premium benefit can combine it with the discount. This benefit allows members to book SAS Plus at the price of SAS Go, at just 3750 points!
