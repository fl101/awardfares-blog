American Airlines is heavily revamping their inflight experience for a more enjoyable journey this summer season. A wave of premium upgrades is coming your way, including new amenity kits, bedding, and delicious menu options. Let's have a look at the details!

## Fresh Amenities and Sustainable Practices

We bet every traveler loves amenity kits. Well, these are great news then. American is introducing a first-of-its-kind program featuring a rotating collection of amenity kits. These stylish kits will showcase diverse designers and brands throughout the year, with a focus on sustainable materials and causes important to the airline and its customers. The kits will also include high-quality skincare products, making every flight feel more luxurious.

### Limited-Edition Amenity Kits for Collectors

In addition to the rotating amenity kits, American Airlines will offer limited-edition specialty kits designed in collaboration with various US-based designers and brands. These special kits will celebrate important milestones and initiatives that reflect the airline's values and the backgrounds of its passengers and crew. Keep an eye out for these collector's items!

## Superb New Bedding

After listening to many rounds of customer surveys, American finally decided to provide enhanced bedding for a more comfortable flight experience. Passengers will now enjoy new bedding, pillows, and sleepwear designed. This includes dual-sided pillows with different materials on each side, slippers in Flagship Business Class for international flights, and premium duvets and fleece blankets made from recycled materials for all cabins.

The new American Airlines menus are inspired by popular destinations worldwide. Passengers flying to summer destinations like Nice, Naples, or Copenhagen can savor dishes like macadamia-crusted sea bass with citrus cream sauce. In Business Class, travelers can indulge in internationally-inspired pastas, salads, and other delicious options, including new pre-order choices like short rib mac and cheese.
