The recent announcement of Air France-KLM’s acquisition of SAS has raised many questions for current EuroBonus members. As the loyalty landscapes merge, many (including us at AwardFares) are re-evaluating whether to remain with EuroBonus or transition to Flying Blue.

In this guide, we aim to provide a detailed comparison between the two programs, highlighting key differences and considerations that could influence your decision in this new era of airline alliances.

## Overview of EuroBonus: Understanding the New Context

EuroBonus, traditionally the loyalty program of Scandinavian Airlines, now falls under a broader umbrella due to the Air France-KLM acquisition, and the transition to SkyTeam. This development could potentially expand EuroBonus’s horizons with more integrated services and enhanced benefits, leveraging the strengths of a larger aviation group.

Key Features:

- **Airline Partners**: Part of Star Alliance until September 1st, 2024.
- **Point Earning**: Members earn points based on the fare and the flight length.
- **Point Redemption**: Points can be used for booking new flights, upgrading seats, or shopping in the EuroBonus shop.

## Overview of Flying Blue

Flying Blue serves as the official frequent flyer program for Air France, KLM, and several other subsidiary airlines. It is known for its flexibility in earning and spending miles and its range of elite status benefits. Flying Blue also collaborates with SkyTeam alliance members, broadening the scope for accumulation and redemption of miles.

Key Features:

- **Airline Partners**: Includes all SkyTeam members, offering a comprehensive network of global destinations.
- **Mile Earning**: Miles are earned based on the amount spent on tickets rather than the distance flown.
- **Mile Redemption**: Miles can be redeemed for flights, upgrades, hotel stays, car rentals, and even shopping.

## Key Differences Between EuroBonus and Flying Blue

### Earning Rewards

- EuroBonus: Points are primarily earned based on the travel class and length of the flight. This can benefit frequent flyers who travel long distances.
- Flying Blue: Miles are earned based on the price of the flight ticket, which can advantage those who purchase pricier tickets, regardless of the distance.

### Redemption Flexibility

- EuroBonus: Offers a straightforward redemption process, with a clear structure for how many points are needed for flights and upgrades.
- Flying Blue: Provides more flexibility with a variable pricing model for redemptions, where the number of miles required can vary based on ticket demand and pricing.

### Elite Status

- EuroBonus: Has multiple tiers, with each level offering progressively better benefits including extra baggage allowance, lounge access, and priority services.
- Flying Blue: Also features tiered statuses, but includes additional perks such as rollover miles and more generous reward mile bonuses.

### Additional Benefits

- EuroBonus: Offers unique collaborations with various non-airline partners, allowing members to earn points through everyday activities.
- Flying Blue: Features occasional promotions such as discounted mileage redemptions and exclusive deals with hotel and car rental partners.

## Here's what to consider

- Home Country and Flying habits: If you fly frequently with SkyTeam airlines, EuroBonus might still be a good fit. However, Flying Blue offers more earning opportunities beyond flying.
- Travel style: Do you value predictable award costs (EuroBonus) or the chance to score deals (Flying Blue)?
- Elite status: If you cherish EuroBonus Diamond perks, wait for official news on how they translate to Flying Blue.
