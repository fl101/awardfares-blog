The EuroBonus program is buzzing this spring, and we're here to keep you in the loop with all the latest news. Every month, we summarize the hottest topics, so you can stay effortlessly informed.

This April, there are several key items on the agenda, most notably the ongoing transition from [Star Alliance to SkyTeam](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-transition-to-skyteam/). Let's jump right in!

## SAS EuroBonus Updates (April 2024)

### 1. SAS will join SkyTeam on September 1

SAS confirmed that the transition to SkyTeam will be effective on September 1, 2024. [You can read all the details around the announcement](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-transition-to-skyteam/). The shift has a number of implications for booking and redeeming award flights with EuroBonus points.

You can be prepared with our [Ultimate Guide to Using SAS EuroBonus Points](https://blog.awardfares.com/eurobonus-guide/). We carefully crafted the guide to help you find the best (free) flights on SAS and Star Alliance before the airline leaves and, ultimately, on SkyTeam partners once the airline enters the new alliance and integrates with those partners.

### 2. Discounts on cash tickets with SAS (Book by April 22nd)

SAS is running heavily discounted prices on revenue tickets, valid for bookings until April 22nd. We've seen prices starting at 4000kr for both destinations in the USA and Asia.

This is a great opportunity not only to get cheap flights to interesting destinations, but also to accrue extra EuroBonus points or challenge for a higher status if you are running short during your qualification period.

* **Travel Period**: November 1, 2024 - March 29, 2025.
* **Book by**: April 22, 2024

### 3. Thai Temporarily Disappears from EuroBonus Booking Portal

During April, there was a glitch/update on the EuroBonus portal in which [**it was not possible to redeem points for flights on Thai Airways**](https://blog.awardfares.com/thai-stops-working-with-eurobonus/). This happened after [United also disappeared from the search portal](https://blog.awardfares.com/united-stops-working-with-eurobonus/). Luckily, the functionality was restored after several hours.

**Heads up!** It's important to keep an eye on these changes and be prepared to embrace change. We advise all EuroBonus members to make any desired bookings right away if they see availability. The situation is changing rapidly, and there's no guarantee that the integration with each partner airline will remain available until SAS officially leaves Star Alliance on August 31. At AwardFares, we've witnessed several sudden changes without any notice regarding awards on partner airlines.
