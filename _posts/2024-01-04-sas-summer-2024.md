Exciting times to be a Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) enthusiast! In spite of the uncertainty around switching to SkyTeam and leaving Star Alliance, there's still a positive angle to the story. The airline has announced an extensive expansion of its flight schedule, adding **nine new routes** to its list of over 130 destinations in more than 40 countries.

The expansion features new routes originating from SAS's primary hub in Copenhagen, as well as from Oslo and Bergen. The airline will introduce flights from Copenhagen to Tromsø, Salzburg, and Genoa. Additionally, for the peak summer period, SAS will offer routes from Copenhagen to Dalaman and Ibiza, from Oslo to Geneva and Tivat, and from Bergen to London Heathrow.

In addition to the international expansion, SAS is also powering up its domestic flight schedule. The airline plans to increase the number of flights from Stockholm to various Swedish destinations. Enhanced services will also be seen from Copenhagen to Bergen and from Oslo to Aalborg and Billund.

SAS's summer schedule is not just limited to European destinations. The airline is also extending its reach with long-haul expansions, particularly to North America. This includes an increase in flights from Copenhagen to New York (JFK), operated by the Airbus A321LR, in addition to the existing daily A330 service to Newark (EWR). The Copenhagen-Boston route will see a boost to daily flights, operated by the Airbus A350-900, and the Copenhagen-Toronto service will also see an increase in frequency.

The airline's Asian routes are also getting a significant upgrade. SAS plans to increase the frequency of flights from Copenhagen to Shanghai, Tokyo, and extend its service to Bangkok.
