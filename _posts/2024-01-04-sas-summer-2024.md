In spite of the uncertainty around [switching to SkyTeam and leaving Star Alliance](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-acquisition/), there's still a positive angle to the story. The airline has announced an extensive expansion of its flight schedule, adding **nine new routes** to its list of over 130 destinations in more than 40 countries.

The expansion features new routes originating from SAS's primary hub in Copenhagen, as well as from Oslo and Bergen. The airline will introduce flights from Copenhagen to Tromsø, Salzburg, and Genoa.
