We recently announced a new [Gold/Diamond](https://awardfares.com/pricing) feature that lets you see cabin information for certain flights. Read more here [Introducing Cabin Annotations](/cabin-annotations/). Today we've released cabin annotations for many more airlines and even added support for seat maps.

## Seat Maps
For a large number of flights there is now a direct link to the correct SeatGuru seat map. A seat map link is available when a "seat" icon in shown next to the aircraft type. Click the link to open the SeatGuru seat map.

Note that this feature is currently only available for aircraft types where we are able to determine the exact seat map used for a flight (e.g. not when multiple layouts are available for the same aircraft type and route). 

We will continue to improve support for seat map links, and hopefully in the future also provide real-time seat availability maps for flights showing which seats are available at the time of planning a journey.

## More Cabin Types
Previously we added support for cabin types on some ANA flights and most Singapore Airlines. Now we've increased cabin types to nearly all Star Alliance members. For some airlines we show the business cabin layout (e.g. 1-2-1 or 2-2-2 seating). For other airlines we also show which specific cabin is available on a flight. Here are some examples:

#### Air Canada (Signature Class):
