**UPDATE: As of 2024, we stopped supporting Avianca LifeMiles due to recent changes in the connectiong to the program. You can still search for awards on Avianca using other providers.**

The LifeMiles award chart can be one of the most lucrative ones for frequent flyers, so much, that it has increasingly gained popularity among Europeans and residents of the United States.

The value of Avianca LifeMiles has remained quite stable over the past few years, and redemptions in premium cabins (Business Class and First) are slightly cheaper compared to other programs.

**But can you find seats available?** In this post, we cover the best Avianca LifeMiles awards with _real_ availability, including our favorite picks.

## Avianca LifeMiles Sweet Spots (Our Top Picks) {#sweet-spots}

Here are our top Avianca LifeMiles redemptions, and how to find them using AwardFares (click to search).

### 1. [New York to Europe in Business Class](https://awardfares.com/search?area:NYC.zone:Europe.;c:business;z:lifemiles)

You can fly this route on many Star Alliance partners including Lufthansa, Austrian and even Singapore Airlines for around 63,000 miles, a great deal for a premium cabin award, as it's significantly cheaper than many other programs.

### 2. [Europe to Tokyo on ANA Business Class](https://awardfares.com/search?area:LON.area:TYO.;c:business;z:lifemiles)

This flight is a rare find, with only a few seats released close to the date, but it is on the top of LifeMiles redemptions if you can score one. Try setting an alert using AwardFares to get notified via email when seats open.

**Note**: Some ANA flights feature the new Business Class cabin with enclosed compartments, which AwardFares highlights. Try filtering by flight number (e.g. NH211 and NH212).

### 3. [Intra-Europe Flights](https://awardfares.com/search?zone:Europe.zone:Europe.;z:lifemiles)

Flying across Europe during the summer can be quite expensive. But for 10,000-30,0000 miles you can get a ton of value during peak season, especially on premium cabins such as Lufthansa or Brussels Airlines Business Class.

Alternatively, if you don't have a set travel date, you can select the **Timeline View** to explore the availability for multiple days simultaneously. The bars show different classes in different colors.
