## 5 Mistakes When Searching EVA Air Award Flights

### 1. Relying Solely on [EVA Air Website](https://www.evaair.com/) for Availability

**Mistake**: Many travelers begin and end their award flight search on EVA Air's official website, thinking it provides the most accurate and comprehensive availability.

**Fix**: While the airline's website provides some availability, [AwardFares](https://awardfares.com/search?..;a:BR#) offers a more user-friendly interface and comprehensive search tools that scan multiple dates and routes. By using AwardFares, travelers can get a clearer picture of available flights, ensuring they make the most out of their points.

### 2. Not Checking Partner Airlines

**Mistake**: Travelers often forget that award flight availability is not only influenced by EVA Air but also by its partner airlines in the Star Alliance network.

**Fix**: AwardFares aggregates information from multiple airlines, including Star Alliance members. This means you can view availability across various partners, giving you more flexibility and options for your travels.

### 3. Overlooking Peak Travel Dates

**Mistake**: Travelers frequently set their sights on popular travel dates without considering the high demand during those times.

**Fix**: With AwardFares, users can utilize its intuitive calendar feature which highlights peak travel times. This allows travelers to adjust their plans accordingly, ensuring they maximize the value of their miles.

### 4. Not Setting Up Alerts

**Mistake**: EVA Air award chart is complicated, plus the availability is sporadic: what's not available today might be open tomorrow. Continually checking EVA Air's website isn't just time-consuming; it's also inefficient.

**Fix**: Our [Alerts feature](https://blog.awardfares.com/alerts/) is a must-have for proactive travelers. Specify your criteria and get real-time notifications as soon as a matching award seat emerges.

Here's an example of setting an alert for availability on EVA Air flights.

### 5. Dealing With Cumbersome User Interfaces

**Mistake**: EVA Air's website can be tricky. Whether it's slow loading times, confusing navigation, or sudden errors, the search can get cumbersome.

**Fix**: AwardFares prides itself on its sleek, intuitive interface. Simple to navigate and power-packed with features, it ensures your award searching is hassle-free and efficient. Hey, it's also mobile-friendly, ready for searching for that perfect award trip while on-the-go.

### BONUS. Not Searching Via Bangkok (BKK)

**Mistake**: EVA Air operates a lot of their flights TPE-BKK-Europe. Sometimes, there are seats available on Europe-BKK, or vice versa, while that same flight doesn’t have availability to/from TPE.

**Fix** Include both TPE and BKK in searches when finding availabilty in AwardFares
