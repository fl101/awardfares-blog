Singapore Airlines (SQ) is a great airline and serves as a major hub in Asia, serving North America, Europe, and Oceania. Finding award redemptions has always been tricky, but since the start of the COVID pandemic, redeeming award flights on Singapore Airlines through partner programs has become even more difficult and with many restrictions.

Most major frequent flyer programs have since started to resume Economy and Business redemptions on short-haul flights within Asia. For long-haul flights connecting to Europe or North America, most programs only offer Economy redemptions.

## Best Availability
Among the best Star Alliance programs **EVA Air's Infinity MileageLands** program definitely takes the lead, offering the full range of SQ redemptions on all routes, including First Class (although limited to 777 non-suite).

## Worst Availability
Among the worst is unfortunately **SAS EuroBonus**, which used to offer SQ redemptions (including First Class). However, they are still after nearly two years still blaming "technical issues". Perhaps they just aren't willing to resume SQ redemptions (due to cost cutting?) seeing as most other major programs have since resumed SQ redemptions. At this point it is unclear when (or even if) they will resume these redemptions.
