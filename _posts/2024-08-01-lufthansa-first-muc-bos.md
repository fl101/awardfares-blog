While Lufthansa recently started the rollout of their [Allegris product](/lufthansa-allegris-first-flight), it's far from done, and in fact, the First Class cabin still needs to be updated. That being said, the current Lufthansa First Class is still a great product, and I was lucky enough to fly it from [Munich to Boston](https://awardfares.com/search?MUC.BOS.;c:first;a:LH).

## How I Booked This Flight

With SAS being my primary frequent flyer program and their upcoming exit from Star Alliance I wanted to take one last opportunity to enjoy the Lufthansa First Class experience. While it's always been tricky to find First Class seats, AwardFares will automatically search [all LH First routes](https://awardfares.com/search?..;c:first;a:LH;z:sas) so that you can easily get an overview of what's available. This availability is estimated based on other programs, though, so in the end, the call to the booking agent will determine if you can get the seat. In my case, I was lucky, and the two seats I saw were indeed available. With some help from the agent, we found fitting connections in both Frankfurt and Munich to maximize the experience.

## Seat And Cabin

While the seats show their age a little, they're still massive and extremely comfortable. The A380 cabin is also much more spacious than the 747 and A340 I've tried before. The First Class cabin is on the upper deck and has 8 seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. The seats are very private and offer plenty of storage space, including a personal wardrobe. The seat can be adjusted in many ways and folds down fully for sleeping; the staff will also help you make the bed with a mattress pad and duvet. With the cabin being in the top front, the engine noise is minimal; we could have a conversation without raising our voices, even during take-off.

A quirk of the front of the A380 is the two areas on either side of the front staircase. Different airlines have used these spaces in other ways, such as Lufthansa choosing to make two giant but long bathrooms. They both feature a long bench to sit on, which looks very elegant but serves no practical purpose. Other airlines have used the space for lounge areas, with the bathrooms slightly smaller, which would be a better use. A fun quirk is that Lufthansa offers a payphone next to the bathrooms, although calls are charged $9.95/min, and you'd certainly have to be desperate to use it.

## Food And Drink Service

Food and Drinks are always excellent with Lufthansa First Class and this time was no different. Sadly, since the flight is one of the shortest ones with First Class, there was relatively little time to enjoy the food, but the quality was excellent.

The service starts with a pre-departure drink (unlike in business class, where they're happy to open any drink they have on board, not just the champagne) and some macadamia nuts. Once in the air, the meal is a full five-course dinner consisting of an *amuse bouche*, caviar, starters, a main course, and dessert. The selection of main courses usually includes a meat, fish and vegetarian option which in my experience have all been excellent. The extensive wine list and the crew are always happy to help you find the perfect pairing.

On this particular flight, the second serving was a light dinner instead of a breakfast since the arrival time was around 8 p.m. in Boston. As there were only four passengers in the cabin (which seats 8), there was some leftover caviar from the first service, which the crew was happy to serve us as a second course.

## Airport And Lounge

If you have a First Class ticket on a flight departing the same day, you can access the Lufthansa First Class Terminal and any of their First Class Lounges, even if your flight departs from another airport. We had an overnight layover, starting the day in Frankfurt, following up with a short stay in Munich, and finally, the First Class flight in the afternoon.

</figure>

This allowed us to visit the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the First Class Lounge in Munich. The First Class Terminal is a unique experience; a lounge attendant will greet you upon arrival and take care of everything from checking in the luggage (In our case, that was already done in Stockholm) to escorting you through a private security check. Once inside, the terminal offers a la carte dining, a cigar lounge, a quiet room with daybeds and bathtubs, and a well-stocked bar with a generous selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

On the morning of our flight, some climate activists shut down the airport for a few hours, and it was noticeable in the terminal as the staff worked hard to solve the issues arising from delayed and canceled flights. The lounge was also significantly more crowded than usual as passengers were waiting for their flights to be rescheduled.

Both breakfast and lunch were excellent, with both a la carte and buffet options available. The service is fast. We sat down for lunch about 30 minutes before boarding and were able to comfortably finish our meal without any rush. The menu rotates with current events. For example, there were a few France-themed dishes to celebrate the Olympics, but there were always a few staple meals available, such as Schnitzel and burgers.

Finally, when leaving, the lounge attendant will escort you downstairs, where a car awaits you. Previously, I've always been able to get a private vehicle; however, with how busy the lounge was, this time, we had to share with two other passengers who were on the same flight to Munich.

The First Class Lounge in Munich is a bit more traditional, with buffet and a la carte dining options. Two lounges are available: one in the main terminal and one in the satellite terminal. The satellite terminal lounge offers a better view of the tarmac and an outdoor terrace. The lounge is located in both the Schengen and non-Schengen areas, so you can do passport control in the lounge and avoid the queues in the terminal.

## Amenity Kit

The amenity kit is sadly one of the only bad parts of the Lufthansa First Class experience. In the past, the kit was a Rimowa and an elegant Sinn leather box, but now it's a very basic bag with a few L'Occitane products. The bag is made of very cheap material and the products inside are nothing special. The only thing that stands out is the very comfortable socks. The pajamas are great, though, and the slippers have a very thick and cushy sole, making them highly comfortable.

## IFE And Wi-Fi

The IFE is one of the few disappointments in Lufthansa's First Class cabin. It's clearly showing its age through the relatively small screen, which is exacerbated by the fact that the screen is quite far away from the seat since the seat pitch is so large. The screen is also extremely slow, and it certainly feels dated in today's world of snappy smartphones. The selection is alright, though, with plenty of new and old movies. Sadly, my favorite thing about the A380, the tail camera, wasn't working on this flight.

Lufthansa offers First Class free Wi-Fi services, which worked great throughout the flight.

## Sleep

Sleep in First Class is always excellent; in this case, it is a bit short due to the short flight time, but the bed is very comfortable, and the crew will help you make it with a mattress pad and duvet. The cabin is also hushed, and the seat is very private, so you can sleep without any disturbances. The seat is very soft, and combined with the mattress pad, it's as comfortable as any hotel bed. Of course, earplugs and sleeping masks are provided in the amenity kit should you need them. The crew will also ask you when you want to be woken up; in this case, they suggested 1 hour and 45 minutes before landing, but as we wanted some extra sleep, we asked for 1 hour before landing, which still gave us enough time for a quick meal and changing back to regular clothes.

## Conclusion

Lufthansa First Class is a fantastic product all around. I often explain that the difference between business and first class is almost as big as between economy and business class. While one might argue that "it's just a bigger seat and better food," I think that misses an essential part of First Class, which is the luxury touch. From the separate terminal to the attendant fetching you when it's time to board, the limo to the flight, the whole experience is designed so that you, as a passenger, shouldn't have to think about the fact that you're flying. Flying is just a thing that happens around you while enjoying a great meal, a good selection of drinks, and a comfortable bed.

While they aren't the best in any individual category, they offer the best package experience out of all the First Class airlines I've tried. I will undoubtedly miss flying with them when SAS leaves Star Alliance.
