Back in June, [Alaska Mileage Plan announced a partnership with STARLUX Airlines](https://blog.awardfares.com/alaska-mileageplan-updates-june-2023/), which means you can now start earning and redeeming miles on their flights.

STARLUX Airlines flyes to a myriad of destinations, from Los Angeles (LAX) to popular places in Southeast Asia, including Bangkok ([BKK](https://awardfares.com/search?LAX.BKK.;z:alaska)), Danang ([DAD](https://awardfares.com/search?LAX.DAD.;z:alaska)), and Hanoi ([HAN](https://awardfares.com/search?LAX.HAN.;z:alaska)), via Taipei ([TPE](https://awardfares.com/search?LAX.TPE.;z:alaska)). STARLUX also has a vibrant business class product that it is totally worth trying. 

Redemptions for award flights were made available a few days ago. As soon as they were announced, we quickly jumped on making some searches. However, Alaska's Mileage Plan website and interface are slow and hard to use when exploring possible destinations and dates.

Instead, AwardFares lets you search for STARLUX award availability in a glimpse. Quickly browse through available options using our beautiful Timeline view, and even set up alerts to get notified when award seats become available. Here's a step-by-step guide.

## Find STARLUX redemptions using Alaska Mileage Plan Miles

### 1. Log in to [AwardFares](https://awardfares.com).

### 2. Select Frequent Flyer Program.

In the **Frequent Flyer Program** picker, select **Alaska Mileage Plan**.

### 3. Under **Airline**, select **STARLUX**.

Use the airline filter to select STARLUX airlines only. This will allow you to see available award flights on that specific airline.

### 4. Choose the route.

If you have a route in mind already, you can use the **From** and **To** fields to enter your departure and arrival airports.

Alternatively, you can also perform broad searches from an entire area, region, or metropolitan area (like a city, New York NYC). Or, give it a shot and include multiple origins and destinations.

### 5. Add travel dates.

Try adding specific dates to refine your search results. Once selected, AwardFares will start searching for available flights for that date, and will display them in a list below. 

If you don't have a set travel date, you can enable the **Timeline View** to explore the availability for multiple days simultaneously. The bars show different classes (Economy, Premium Economy, Business, First) in different colors.

To search for different dates using the timeline view, simply click on the arrows icon under the day you are interested. You can trigger multiple searches at once (limits apply for different tiers [Gold](https://awardfares.com/pricing) and [Diamond](https://awardfares.com/pricing))

### 6. Add more filters (optional).

Try filtering out by cabin class (e.g. Business Class, First Class) or number of stops (e.g. nonstop). In this example, we filter results to only show Business Class seats.

There are many more filters you can explore adding, such as number of passengers, aircraft type, number of stops and even flight number.

### 7. Done.

Pretty easy, right? In just a few clicks, you can see Mileage Plan inventory on STARLUX airlines.
