Delta SkyMiles, Delta Air Lines' loyalty program, has one of the widest arrays of redemption options, not only regarding routes but also partner airlines. Recent announcements have upset a large portion of their members [with significant changes for 2024](https://www.delta.com/us/en/skymiles/medallion-program/2024-program-updates) because it will be harder and more expensive to qualify for elite status.

However, SkyMiles remains a solid program for US-based members, especially considering several ongoing credit card offers with sign-up bonuses of up to 100k or even 150k when combining multiple cards.

If you have a pile of Delta SkyMiles at your disposal or plan on getting them soon through some of the ongoing offers, this post is for you. We'll cover the best SkyMiles sweets spots, how to determine how much your miles are worth, and how to find good redemptions using AwardFares.

## Get 100,000 SkyMiles In 90 Days (Or More)

If you are interested in learning how to rack up a ton of SkyMiles in a few months, here are some great resources to check out before this post:

- [How To Earn 100,000 Delta SkyMiles [In 90 Days]](https://upgradedpoints.com/travel/airlines/earn-100k-delta-skymiles/) *by Upgraded Points*
- [New Delta Limited Time Offers: How to Maximize Up to 100,000 SkyMiles](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/new-delta-limited-time-offers-how-to-maximize-up-to-100000-skymiles) *by NerdWallet*

## How Much Are 100k Delta SkyMiles Worth?

The value of Delta SkyMiles varies depending on how you redeem them. Typically, you need to look at **the price of the flight in cash** and compare it to **how many miles you are spending** to book the award flight.

However, a good rule of thumb is to consider that the average value of a SkyMile is around **1.1 cents** (USD). This means that 100,000 SkyMiles are worth about $1100 (USD).

### Calculate The Value Of Your SkyMiles (Tool)

The mini tool below lets you calculate the value of your SkyMiles redemption in cents per mile (CPM).

Just enter:

- The price of your flight in cash (use Google Flights or Delta's Website).
- The price of your flight in SkyMiles (use AwardFares or Delta's Website).
- The taxes and fees required to book a flight using SkyMiles (use AwardFares or Delta's Website).

**Tip**: If the CPM value you see is over 1.1 cent, then you are getting a relatively good redemption. The higher, the better.
