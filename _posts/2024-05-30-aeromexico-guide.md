You can accrue points by flying with Aeromexico and their partner airlines, or through everyday purchases. Essentially, Aeromexico Rewards allows you to turn your travels and everyday spending into future travel opportunities.

### 5. Add more filters (optional)

Try filtering out by cabin class (e.g., Business Class, First Class), number of stops (e.g., nonstop), number of passengers, aircraft type, or even flight number!

### 6. Book with Air France or KLM

Once you find your desired flight, click the Book button.

AwardFares will redirect you to Air France’s website to complete your booking without the need to re-enter your search criteria, as it will be pre-populated. Note that Flying Blue does not have a centralized booking portal, so you'll need to book through either Air France or KLM website.
