I had been monitoring award availability to fly back to Europe for Christmas. During the middle of October (two months prior to departure date) some Business class seats opened up on SK984, the SAS flight from Haneda (HND) to Copenhagen (CPH).

## Efficient Departure out of Haneda

Japan is full of tourists at the moment, so Haneda International Terminal was quite busy. Even though Japanese airports are very efficient, there was still a bit of a queue for security, so I was happy to be able to use the Fast Track instead, which you have access to if you're flying Business class with SAS.

Once through security and passport control, any Star Alliance flight out of Tokyo usually starts with some curry at the ANA Lounge. The ANA lounges tend to get very busy, but on this occasion (8am on a weekday) it wasn't too bad.

## A Familiar and Comfortable Cabin

The A350, just like all of the other SAS wide-body aircraft offer 1-2-1 seating. If you're aiming for a window seat, make sure to grab an even numbered row so that your seat is closer to the window, offering a bit of extra privacy and comfort while sleeping. Alternatively row 1 is also a good choice, as you'll get a bit of extra legroom at these seats.

The SAS cabin has become very familiar to me over the years, and I still find it to be very comfortable. I'm just not a huge fan of air-cushion seats. They do fail from time to time, leaving you with a flat seat, which happened to me [recently on a Lufthansa flight](/lufthansa-long-haul-business-a350/). Luckily on this flight I had no issues, and in any case, the cabin was barely half full so I would have had access to another seats if it did.

The A350 felt fresh and looks almost identical to the A330 cabin. There are some minor differences though, like the table, which has a slightly different shape. It is very sturdy, making them great for getting some work done on your laptop.

## Flying the Polar Route

Prior to departure, the purser made an announcement explaining that SAS was the first airline in the world to fly a polar route, connecting Europe to Asia. Actually, this wasn't my first time flying the Polar Route though, since I had done so with [Finnair earlier during the year](/finnair-hel-hnd-business/). Unlike Finnair, SAS did not hand out a diploma, however, they did offer a special Polar Route cocktail, which is only available on this flight!

## Excellent catering

I've always been a huge fan of catering on SAS long-haul flights, particularly on the Tokyo route, where it seems they always put a little bit of extra effort into the service and catering. This flight was no exception, with some interesting food options featuring a Japanese twist.

Service started as usual with a beverage and nuts. I decided to try the "Above the clouds" mocktail, which was a very refreshing combination of cranberry juice, apple juice, and sprite.

For my meal I started by ordering the smoked red tuna, which was delicious.

Followed by, probably one of my favorite in-flight meals ever. This slow-cooked duck was absolutely fantastic. Juicy, melt in your mouth tender, and the mix of Scandinavian and Japanese inspired flavors was fantastic.

To finish off, I ordered the fruit and tart. I really appreciated the addition of Kaki (かき) fruit (Japanese persimmon).

## Decent connectivity and entertainment

The movie selection on SAS is usually pretty good. They have some old classics, and some new releases. It was also nice to see a small selection of Christmas movies. As usual, I ended up mostly watching my own entertainment on my iPad, but ended up working most of the first part of the flight, which was a good idea, since the WiFi worked well. Unfortunately the WiFi stopped working once we reached the North Pole, and remained out of service for the rest of the flight down over Norway, Sweden, and eventually arriving into Denmark.

## Mediocre pre-landing meal

Again, as usual, the second meal serving was quite mediocre; definitely not as good as the main meal. The beef loin was quite chewy, and the shrimp and vegetable gyoza was not really to my liking.

## Early arrival into Copenhagen

Shortly after, we dipped down below the clouds, arriving into a cold winter afternoon in Copenhagen.

We actually arrived over 1 hour ahead of schedule, which in this case meant I'd have nearly a 6 hour layover, waiting for my connecting flight to take me over to Amsterdam.

If you do find yourself with a long layover in Copenhagen, you can head out of the airport and grab the Metro that takes you right into downtown Copenhagen in about 20 minutes.

## Summary

SAS still offers a fantastic travel experience between Europe and Far East Asia thanks to the A350, the fresh cabin, and excellent catering. It is also a fantastic award bargain for EuroBonus members that have FlyPremium status with the SAS EuroBonus MasterCard since you're able to book Business class redemptions for the price of Economy!
