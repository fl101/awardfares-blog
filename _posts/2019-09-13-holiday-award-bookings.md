The AwardFares calendar is one of the easiest ways to find great award redemptions. Today we've enhanced the calendar to show additional "special" dates (beyond the normal 60 days). You can now browse 400+ routes during Christmas and New Year between [December 20th and January 8th](https://awardfares.com/search?..2019-12-20:2020-01-08).

We hope this will make it easier to find award availability for your holiday plans. Note that Christmas and New Year dates are currently only available to [Gold/Diamond](https://awardfares.com/pricing) members since these dates are more than 60 days in the future.

Are there any other holiday/special dates that you think AwardFares should search automatically? Let us know via [social media](#sm) or [email](https://awardfares.com/help) if you have any suggestions!
