Lufthansa is one of the world's leading carriers, with access to nearly 1,300 destinations worldwide, an extensive global network, and high-quality service. It is a very reliable alternative, especially when you are flying premium cabins such as Business and First Class. As a founding member of Star Alliance, it’s possible to book Lufthansa flights from other frequent flyer programs, such as SAS EuroBonus.

Historically, there have been many EuroBonus sweet spots on Lufthansa, including good redemptions on Lufthansa First Class, and low fuel surcharges and fees on Business Class. But what’s the status in 2024?

In this post, we cover why SAS EuroBonus is still a great program when redeeming award flights on Lufthansa, and a step-by-step guide to finding and booking Lufthansa flights with EuroBonus points using AwardFares.

**UPDATE 15 MAR 2024:** SAS will be leaving Star Alliance and joining SkyTeam during Q2, 2024. Details of the transition haven't been disclosed yet, but this means that it will no longer be possible to book award flights on Star Alliance partners using SAS EuroBonus points.

## EuroBonus was great for awards on Lufthansa. Now what?

In 2023, SAS announced that it will be acquired by Air France-KLM and others, leaving Star Alliance and joining SkyTeam. This event marks the first time

Redeeming awards on Lufthansa and Swiss has always been a solid options for SAS EuroBonus members. A huge network, great frequencies, solid onboard products and high availability were some of the key highlights of the golden age of the Lufthansa Group and EB. It was also a great opportunity to use Amex 2 for 1 vouchers (companion tickets), on First Class. Those days will be soon long gone.

Our two cents:

1. Try booking outstanding flights now if you have leftover points or vouchers, and were looking to fly LH one last time.
2. If you will still be primarily flying with Star Alliance partners and accruing in EuroBonus, try switching to another program. United MileagePlus is a great option along with Aeroplan for both European and US-based members.
3. If you are based in the Nordics and earn most points through flying SAS or credit card spending, then it's most likely that you will soon be able to start redeeming awards on Air France and KLM. Don't worry, they also have a large network, great options to the US and America in general, and offer excellent service onboard (often better than Lufthansa).

## How to Find Lufthansa Flights with EuroBonus Points

### 1. Go to AwardFares

Creating an account is optional, but it's also free, and it gives you access to more features. Make sure to [sign up for one here](https://awardfares.com/signup).

### 2. Select SAS EuroBonus as your Frequent Flyer Program

On AwardFares homepage, you will see a Frequent Flyer Program Picker (FFP). Tap on it and select **EuroBonus**. This will only perform searches and show you award seats available using EuroBonus points.

</figure>

### 3. Filter out by Airline

</figure>

### 4. Select the Route

If you already have your departure and destination city, you can add those under the **Where From** and **Where To** fields. Once you do so, you will be able to see a Timeline.

</figure>

### 5. Perform a broad search

If you have flexibility on the routes, AwardFares is powerful as Google Flights. It lets you explore options available by performing what we call **broad searches**. You can see available flights by selecting only departure, arrival city, or regions. For example, you can explore all flights from **Europe** to the **United States** by simply typing those regions.

</figure>

### 6. Filter out by cabin (optional)

Using the **Cabin** filter you can select **First Class** **Only**. This will remove all other cabins, such as Economy, Premium Economy, and Business, and just show you seats available in First Class.

**Note**: Lufthansa partner redemptions are restricted to 14 days in advance for First class and 85 days for long-haul business. If you are curious about how early Lufthansa releases award seats, check our [guide here](https://blog.awardfares.com/ultimate-guide-to-award-release-dates/).

### 7. Confirm availability on SAS website

Once you have selected the options, you can double-check the availability on SAS website with your own account, searching for the exact same flights and dates you found using AwardFares.

### 8. Set-up alerts (optional)

If you don’t see available seats on a given flight and date you are interested, don’t worry. Seat availability changes daily, as airlines release those seats on short notice. AwardFares has an alert feature that monitors the flights you want and notifies you via email once/if they become available.

To set up an Alert, just tap on **Alerts** > **Add Alert** > and fill out the required information, such as route, dates, passengers, cabin.

### 9. Book on SAS Website

Simple, huh? AwardFares, lets you see all the available flights on Lufthansa ready to be booked with SAS EuroBonus points. Keep in mind that most flights you can book directly on SAS website through the Star Alliance award portal. To book certain cabins, such as First Class or Premium economy, you need to call the service center.

## What we love and don't about Lufthansa

Here are some of our pros and cons of flying with Lufthansa

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| **Consistent on-time performance** | **Long-haul Business Class seats are still 2-2-2 instead of 1-2-1**|
| **Wide network of destinations** | **Inconsistent service quality** |
| **Modern fleet** | **Long flight times** |
| **Still flying 747 and A380** | **Can be crowded** |
| **Frankfurt and Munich are easy to connect** | **High cash fares** |

## Best Frequent Flyer Programs to Redeem Lufthansa Awards in 2024

At [AwardFares](https://awardfares.com/signup) we love all frequent flyer programs, but we also need to stay on top of the game, understanding how award charts change over time and identifying the best redemptions so you can make the most out of your points.

When redeeming Lufthansa awards, here are some of our favorite picks

1. [**Air Canada Aeroplan:**](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:aeroplan) This program offers competitive redemption rates for flights on Star Alliance airlines, including Lufthansa, with a zone-based award chart. However, note that fuel surcharges may be added to Lufthansa flights.
2. [**United MileagePlus:**](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:united) United's program often offers good availability for Star Alliance award seats, including on Lufthansa. Its interactive award chart can make it easier to find and book awards. Recently, United has removed its traditional award chart and moved to dynamic pricing, but it remains a solid option for Star Alliance redemptions.
3. [**SAS EuroBonus (until Q2 2024):**](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:eurobonus) As discussed earlier, this program might offer better redemption rates and lower fuel surcharges on certain flights.
4. **Avianca LifeMiles:** Avianca's frequent flyer program has competitive redemption rates for Lufthansa flights, and often does not add surcharges on award tickets. This can make it a cost-effective choice for redeeming Lufthansa flights.
5. **Miles & More:** This is Lufthansa's own frequent flyer program. It often provides the most extensive availability for award seats, especially for First Class tickets and flights operated by Lufthansa.

Regardless of the program you choose, AwardFares can help you understand the available seats at any time, and even alert you when a given route or cabin opens.
