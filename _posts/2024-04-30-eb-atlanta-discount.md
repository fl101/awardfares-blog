## 50% Discount on EuroBonus Award Trips to Atlanta

SAS is banging hard on the new rout to Atlanta and is now offering a 50% points discount on bonus trips!

The offer applies to **round trips in SAS Go Bonus** (Economy). And as usual, children 2-11 years old get 50% of the point price, even on the already discounted price.

* **Book by**: May 6, 2024
* **Travel period**: 17 June – 31 August 2024
* **Discount**: 50% in SAS Go Bonus

Here's an example of how the discount gets applied during the booking process:

### Find seats to Atlanta using AwardFares

AwardFares is the fastest and easiest way to find available seats using EuroBonus points, as you can search across multiple dates at the same time, applying filters with just a few clicks.

Here's how to search for available seats on the route to Atlanta, to take advantage of the discount:

1. Go to [AwardFares](https://awardfares.com/search) and log-in.
2. Set **EuroBonus** as the *Frequent Flyer Program*.
3. Select the *Route*, for example, **Copenhagen (CPH) or Stockholm (ARN)** to **Atlanta (ATL)**
4. Under *Airline* set **SAS only**. This way you only get flights operated by SAS (instead of the whole Star Alliance).
5. Tap on the *Cabin* pill and set **Economy**. The discount only applies to Economy tickets.
6. Select a date or multiple dates using the Timeline View.

That's it! You'll see the availability displayed in the Timeline

And the full result list below. Tap anywhere on the flight to expand and see more details such as prices. Note that the discounted price will be shown on the SAS booking website during the booking (not on AwardFares).
