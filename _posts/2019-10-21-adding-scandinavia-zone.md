Just a small update today. We have now added a new zone for Scandinavia so that you can easily find award flights to or from all Scandinavian airports.

Keep in mind that when performing broad searches (with continents, countries and zones) you will not be able to perform any custom searches. To perform custom searches make sure to use specific airport codes instead.

* Specific search: [https://awardfares.com/search?CPH,ARN,OSL.EWR.](https://awardfares.com/search?CPH,ARN,OSL.EWR.)
