AwardFares' **Wide Search** feature is one of the most powerful we've ever released: it lets you search for award flights between entire regions or areas at once, which is a huge time saver. Interestingly, it's also one of the most underutilized features.

In this article, we cover everything you should know about wide award searches so that you can leverage their maximum power and always score an award on the routes you want. Let's start!

## Understanding Wide Search

Traditionally, when searching for award flights, you would have to specify your exact departure and arrival cities/airports. This can be limiting, especially if you're flexible with your travel plans or if award availability is scarce.

Here's an example of a traditional search [between New York and London, using AAdvantage](https://awardfares.com/search?JFK.LHR.;z:aadvantage). In this case, the departure airport is JFK, and the destination airport is Heathrow.

However, if you want to depart from New York, there are other airports to choose from, such as Newark (EWR) and La Guardia (LGA), as we can see below.

If we try searching from these airports, we might find more award seats available, or even at a better redemption rate. One option is to add those airports in the **Where From/Origin** field in AwardFares. Simply add EWR and LGA to the list below, as we see in the picture below:

In the result list, you'll now see flights from all these airports

However, this is cumbersome, as it forces us to know the names of the airports or cities in that area. The list can become lengthy, and we might not be aware of other airports in the area.

Wide Award Search changes this by allowing you to search for award flights between entire regions or areas, rather than specific cities. This approach broadens your search parameters, increasing your chances of finding available award seats.

## How To Use Wide Search

Instead of adding the airports manually, you can simply write the **name** of a Metropolitan area, for example, **type New York City (NYC)** for *any* airport in New York.

As you type, AwardFares' auto-suggest will clearly show you that it is a Metro Area option in the dropdown menu.

Immediately, as we zoom in, we see that searching from NYC also includes more airports and options available, such as New York Stewart International Airport.

In a similar way, we can perform a wide search on our **Destination** city. In this case, we replace LHR for **London (LON)**, which will also search award flights beyond Heathrow, including airports like Gatwick (LGW), Standstedt (STN), and others.

*ps. Wide searches also works for regions, such as countries (e.g., Belgium) or award chart zones/areas (e.g., Scandinavia).*

## Pro Tips for Mastering Wide Search

* **Combine with alerts**. Set up award availability alerts for your desired route with *Wide Search* enabled. This way, you'll be notified instantly when award seats open up during your three-day window, giving you a head start on booking.
* **Be flexible**. Remember, the wider your search window, the higher your chances of finding award seats. Consider expanding your date range beyond just one day before and after for even more options.
* **Play with filters**. Use filters strategically to narrow down your wide search results and find the award seats that perfectly match your preferences.
* **Consider Alternative Airports**. Wide searches might reveal availability in nearby airports that you hadn't considered.
* **Understand Your Miles**. Know the value and rules of your frequent flyer program to make the most of your miles. Some programs offer connecting flights to airports within the same metro area or region, adding extra cost to the total price in miles.
