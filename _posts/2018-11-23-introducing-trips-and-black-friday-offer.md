Lots of updates, including our Black Friday Offer, introducing AwardFares Trips, Singapore Airlines availability, New Routes & Map.

## AwardFares Trips

Today we're launching a new Gold feature called "Trips". With Trips you can easily search round-trip award fares between any two zones. Perfect for finding your next last-minute First class trip, or a weekend getaway.

## Singapore Airlines Availability

Earlier this year we added Singapore Airlines availability for most of their intercontinental routes, including the world's longest flight between Singapore and New York. Availability is currently limited to Economy and Business class. However, we hope to add First class availability soon as well.

## New Routes & Map

More routes are continuously being added. Over 700 routes are currently available, with recent additions including Singapore routes and several South American routes. As we've been adding new routes, the old route map became too cluttered. So, we recently released a re-designed route map to solve this problem.
