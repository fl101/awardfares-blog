The inaugural flight will take place June 2nd from Copenhagen. At the time of writing, there are still a couple of award seats left, albeit only in economy!

## Availability

Taking a look at the initial availability published, we have found that availability for these flights does differ quite a lot between different partner programs.

We do find that United, Aeroplan and Eurobonus are all being allocated up to two (2) business class seats per flight. LifeMiles on the other hand does not yet have any availability on these flights.
