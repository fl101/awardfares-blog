Two big announcements today. First, we're introducing AwardFare Alerts. Second, we've added First Class awards for some Singapore Airlines.

## AwardFares Alerts
Today we're announcing "Alerts", which has been requested by many of you! Starting today, all Gold members are now able to create award availability alerts (max 5 active) on any route and any date. When new availability is detected you'll immediately receive an email notification.

## Singapore Airlines First Class
Recently we started experimenting with Singapore Airlines First Class availability. You may start to see some availability on the CPH-SIN and SIN-CPH routes. This is still very experimental and should only be used as a "hint" for now.
