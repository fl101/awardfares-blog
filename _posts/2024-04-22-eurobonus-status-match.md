As a SAS EuroBonus member with hard-earned status, you might be wondering how the upcoming shift from Star Alliance to SkyTeam will affect your travel benefits. While the future holds some unknowns, there's a solution you might not be aware of: status matching.

What is Status Matching?

Status matching allows you to leverage your existing elite status in one airline loyalty program to obtain similar status in another program. This can be a great way to maintain perks like priority boarding, lounge access, and baggage allowances even as your preferred airline undergoes changes.

Benefits of Status Matching

Preserve Your Benefits: Don't lose the perks you've earned! Matching your EuroBonus status ensures a smooth transition and continued access to valuable travel benefits.
Explore New Airlines: Status matching opens doors to new travel options within the SkyTeam network. This can be particularly useful if your travel needs change or SAS routes become less convenient.
Boost Your Earning Potential: With status in a new program, you can potentially earn more miles or points on flights with SkyTeam airlines.
How to Status Match Your EuroBonus Status

Unfortunately, SAS EuroBonus doesn't currently offer an official status matching program. However, some SkyTeam airlines have been known to run limited-time promotions for status matching, particularly from other Star Alliance programs.

Here's how to stay informed and maximize your chances:

Airline Websites: Regularly check the websites of major SkyTeam airlines like Delta, KLM, and Korean Air for status match offers. They often announce these promotions on their loyalty program pages.
Travel Blogs and Forums: Stay updated on the latest travel industry trends by following reputable travel blogs and forums like FlyerTalk [FlyerTalk Forums]. These communities often have dedicated threads where users share status match opportunities.
Contact Airlines Directly: While there's no guarantee, you can try contacting the loyalty program department of a SkyTeam airline you're interested in. Politely inquire if they offer status matches and explain your current EuroBonus status.
Important Considerations

Transition Timeline: Keep in mind that the switch from Star Alliance to SkyTeam is still ongoing. The exact date and potential impact on EuroBonus benefits are yet to be confirmed.
Temporary Matches: Some status matches might be temporary, lasting only for a specific period. Be sure to understand the terms and conditions before applying.
Focus on Long-Term Value: When choosing a program to match to, prioritize airlines that align with your future travel plans and offer benefits you value most.
By staying informed and exploring status matching options, you can ensure a smooth transition and continue enjoying valuable travel perks even as the airline landscape evolves. Remember, your loyalty shouldn't be limited – explore your options and make the most of your travel rewards!
