Scandinavian Airlines has an ambitious ramp up plan for summer 2023, and it is working full thrust towards it. In addition to their [newly opened routes to the US](https://blog.awardfares.com/a-review-of-sas-business-to-jfk/) (CPH-JFK), SAS [announced over 20 new routes](https://www.sasgroup.net/newsroom/press-releases/2023/sas-offers-more-routes-and-frequencies-for-the-summer/) and 5000 flights to Europe, the US, and Asia.

**Are you ready?** Some of those routes are bookable right now using EuroBonus points, so make sure to grab a seat. We did a search with AwardFares and here are our top picks.

## SAS Summer 2023 Flights (Top 7 Options)


### 1. Copenhagen to Houston (SK925 A350-900)

If you're a space enthusiast, Houston must be in your bucket list. Make sure to visit the Space Center Houston, where you can experience simulations of spacewalks, tour the facility where astronauts train, and see real-life spacecraft up close. For those interested in history and science, the Houston Museum of Natural Science is a must-visit, with exhibitions on everything from dinosaurs to gems and minerals. It's culinary scene is also diverse and fun.

It's convenient to have a direct flight from one of SAS hubs. There's plenty of availability in May and June on this route, scheduled on the A350-900.

### 2. Aalborg to New York EWR (SK921 A321neo)

Aalborg is the fourth largest city in Denmark, but with heavy traffic to it because of its University, research, engineering, IT, and natural sciences institutions. It made sense for SAS to connect such a heavy business and scientific pole to one of the largest cities in the US.

There are lots of open space on this route to and from New York during May and June. It's operated by their A321neo (Long-range)

### 3. Oslo to Olbia (SK4907 A320neo)

**Watch out!** This one is a temporary destination during spring and summer, but there are not so many seats available, so hurry up if you are interested. Olbia is a charming city on the northeastern coast of the island of Sardinia in Italy. It is known for its stunning beaches, crystal clear waters, and Hollywood-ready harbor. It's a very popular summer destination and one of the hidden gems in Italy. It receives plenty of Scandinavian tourists every year. With its stunning natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and warm Mediterranean climate, Olbia is a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to Sardinia.

We could find a few flights during July both in SAS Go and Business.

### 4. Stockholm to Palma de Mallorca (SK1415/SK2811 A320neo)

Palma is an all-time classic. A hot tip: holidays in Sweden and Norway start earlier than in Spain and Italy, so you can take advantage of off-peak fares, great weather, and uncrowded destinations during June and early July!

We did not find direct flights open yet, but there's availability with a quick connection in Copenhagen. You can also book this flight ex-Copenhagen.

### 5. Stockholm to New York JFK (SK1429/SK2919 A320neo/A330-300)

There are many advantages to visiting New York during the summer season. The weather is generally warm and sunny. It's full of cultural events and festivals, such as the Pride Parade, Shakespeare in the Park, and the New York Musical Festival. The city's outdoor food markets are also in full swing during the summer, but the very best part is that many New Yorkers tend to leave the city during the summer, making it a slightly quieter and less crowded time to visit popular attractions.

There are quite many seats available on both SAS Go and SAS Plus, with a quick hop in Copenhagen.

### 6. Copenhagen to Boston (SK927 A321neo)

Boston is a beautiful University city with a European tint. With Harvard, MIT, and plenty of outdoor attractions and things to do, the summer season offers beautiful weather and a great vibe. Similar to New York, it's quieter during summer, as many of the locals go away.

SAS has a direct route from Copenhagen on their A321neo, with lots of open space during May, June and July.

### 7. Copenhagen to Los Angeles (SK931 A350-900)

This one is one of our top picks. Flying the A350 to Los Angeles is most likely the best way to get there. Los Angeles tends to be very warm during the summer, but within an hour drive you can be in plenty of beaches and paradise destinations.

Wide open space to LAX diretly from Copenhagen. There's also availability from Stockholm with an extra leg on a A320neo.
