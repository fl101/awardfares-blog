Welcome to our SAS EuroBonus monthly updates, March edition! The EuroBonus front is very hot right now, with lots of things going on. Each month, we explore and summarize the most recent developments so you don't have to.

March has some thick items under development, one of which is the transition from Star Alliance to SkyTeam. Let's start!

## SAS EuroBonus Updates (March 2024)

### 1. SAS plans to join SkyTeam during Q2, 2024

This year marks a giant leap for Scandinavian Airlines, particularly for SAS EuroBonus members. The airline will be acquired, among others, by Air France-KLM.

Recently, it was stated in a press release that SAS is planning on leaving Star Alliance in Q2 2024 and joining SkyTeam immediately! This means the game for frequent travelers will change very soon.

**How to prepare for the transition?** Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. We prepared the [Ultimate Guide to Using SAS EuroBonus Points](https://blog.awardfares.com/eurobonus-guide/). The intention is to help you find the best (free) flights on SAS and Star Alliance before the airline leaves and, ultimately, on SkyTeam partners once the airline enters the new alliance and integrates with those partners.

### 2. Free Trip to Asia with SAS Amex Elite (Get 60.000 EB Points)

American Express and SAS offer a new promotion with an insane welcome bonus when applying to the SAS Amex Elite (their highest tier) credit card. This time they offer **60.000 EuroBonus points** (both valid in Sweden and Norway), which is comparable to what premium cards offer in the United States. Typically, it ranges between 12k and 30k points.

The 60k points are enough for a return trip with SAS Go Bonus to/from Asia and North America.

</div>

Here are the conditions:

- The offer is only valid [via the link on the SAS website and channels during March 2024](https://www.americanexpress.com/se/kreditkort/sas-eurobonus-elite/?ieep=05MC2993&cpid=100537334).
- The offer only applies to people who have not been card **or extra card members** in the past 12 months.
- To get the bonus, you must spend at least SEK 45,000 until June 30, 2024.
- The points are transferred by August 31, 2024.
- The card must be active when the bonus is distributed.
- **Important**: If you cancel or downgrade the card within 12 months of being granted, your account will be debited with the value of your received welcome bonus. This prevents people from applying, getting the bonus, and canceling before the entire year.

### 3. United Disappears from EuroBonus Booking Portal

Booking flights on United Airlines using EuroBonus points is no longer an option. Their system fails to display any itineraries, including United flights. These changes could be linked to the recent slowdowns observed in their search engine and are likely associated with the new partnership with Delta Air Lines and the intention to join SkyTeam.
