KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is ramping up for a big addition to its fleet this coming August – the Airbus A321neo. This new aircraft is not just a step up for KLM but a leap forward when it comes to eco-friendliness and passenger experience.

## What's New with KLM's Airbus A321neo

Scheduled to start operations on August 26, 2024, the Airbus A321neo will fly from Amsterdam to European cities like Stockholm, Berlin, and Copenhagen. With a capacity of 227 passengers, this plane is a key part of KLM's strategy to upgrade its fleet for more efficient and sustainable air travel.

One of the most notable features of the A321neo is its environmental friendliness. Equipped with Recaro seats, the aircraft aims to cut down fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by as much as 15%, aligning with global sustainability efforts.

## Seats and Cabin

In collaboration with Recaro, KLM's A321neo will sport a unique seating arrangement. The front of the cabin will have the BL3710 model seats, and the rear will feature the SL3710 model, striking a balance between passenger comfort and flight efficiency.

KLM plans to include a Business Class section (a.k.a. *Eurobusiness Class*) in these aircraft, providing business class travelers with more space and privacy, a perk especially appreciated on shorter flights.

The introduction of the A321neo is part of a broader initiative by the Air France-KLM Group. In 2021, the group placed an order for 100 aircraft from the Airbus A320neo family, highlighting their commitment to a more modern, sustainable fleet.
