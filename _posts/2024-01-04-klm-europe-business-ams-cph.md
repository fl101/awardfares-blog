I was looking to book a flight from Amsterdam (AMS) to Copenhagen (CPH) and remembered I still had some miles in my Delta SkyMiles account. Luckily, it was just enough for a one-way Economy redemption on KLM, which I found thanks to the [new Delta SkyMiles integration](/introducing-delta/) in AwardFares.

During check-in through the KLM app, I saw that there was an option to upgrade to Business class. I decided to give it a try since I hadn't tried KLM Business within Europe before.

## A Slow Start Out of Schiphol

Flying out of Amsterdam is very hit or miss. On this occasion several things didn't go so well. Since I had upgraded to Business (and thanks to my SkyTeam Elite Plus status) I was able to use the Sky Priority to check in my luggage. However, this wasn't a wise choice. It wasn't particularly crowded, but the check-in staff was strictly checking everyone's luggage weight, which meant getting stuck behind a queue of people re-arranging their luggage. It would have been way faster to just use the regular check-in.

At least security control was efficient, and I eventually made my way to the KLM Crown Lounge 25 (Schengen). This lounge is usually very crowded and hectic (and the food selection is usually very disappointing).

Unfortunately my flight ended up being almost 2 hours delayed due to a mechanical issue with the plane. At least the lounge quieted down a lot later in the evening.

I was eventually kicked out of the lounge since it closed at 22:00, and made my way down to the gate where I waited a bit more until I was finally able to board.

## A Fairly Standard Intra-Europe Business, With Friendly Crew

As with most intra-Europe business class, KLM offers 3-3 seating with blocked middle seats, ensuring you have some extra space. Besides that, there was nothing special about this 737-900 cabin.

The crew was very friendly and welcoming. Once airborne the cabin crew came over to welcome me using my surname, which was a nice surprise. Perhaps this was due to my SkyTeam Elite Plus status?

For this short evening flight they served pasta salad with smoked salmon. With my meal I decided to order a Gin and Tonic, which was served in a proper glass, as well as a cup of tea served in a nice Dutch delftware-style cup. I enjoy these small details!

## Summary

I definitely wouldn't go out of my way paying for a KLM intra-Europe business class flight, but it was fun to try. In terms of service and food I would say it was quite similar to [Lufthansa](lufthansa-business-class-to-lisbon/), although at least Lufthansa serves their food on a tray rather than in a box. It's difficult to compete with [Austrian](/austrian-short-haul-business/), which probably has the best food and service in Europe business class among all the European airlines I've tried.
