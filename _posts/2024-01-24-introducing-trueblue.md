## Why JetBlue

JetBlue's TrueBlue program is popular for its straightforward points system and no blackout dates. This fits perfectly with our mission to make award travel accessible and simple. With TrueBlue, you get:

### 1. User-Friendly Points System

One of the standout features of TrueBlue is its straightforward points system. Unlike some programs that have complex rules and calculations, TrueBlue awards points based on the dollar amount spent, making it easier for members to understand how they are earning rewards. In 2024, this simplicity remains a significant draw for members who appreciate transparency in their loyalty programs.

### 2. No Blackout Dates

TrueBlue continues to uphold its policy of no blackout dates for award flights. This feature is particularly appealing to travelers who need the flexibility to book flights during peak travel periods. Members can use their points for any seat, on any JetBlue-operated flight, a benefit that is not universally offered in all loyalty programs.

### 3. Family Pooling of Points

JetBlue TrueBlue's family pooling feature, which allows families or small groups to combine points, is still a unique offering in the airline industry. This system enables families to accumulate points more quickly and use them more effectively, making it easier to plan family vacations or group trips.

### 4. Partnerships and Expanding Network

As of 2024, TrueBlue has expanded its network of partnerships, allowing members to earn and redeem points with a wider range of airlines, hotels, and other travel-related services. This expansion provides greater flexibility and choice for members, enhancing the value of the points they earn.

**Airline partners**: Hawaiian Airlines, Qatar Airways, Emirates, Aer Lingus, Cape Air, Icelandair, South African Airways, and Silver Airways.

### 5. Tiered Membership Benefits

TrueBlue offers tiered membership levels, including Mosaic, which provide additional benefits such as expedited security, early boarding, and bonus points earnings. These tiers cater to frequent flyers, offering perks that make travel more comfortable and efficient.

### 6. Commitment to Sustainability

JetBlue's commitment to sustainability also extends to its TrueBlue program. Members are increasingly looking for environmentally responsible travel options, and TrueBlue has responded by offering opportunities to earn points through sustainable travel choices and to use points for eco-friendly initiatives.
