It's all about giving you more flexibility and more options to make the best out of your points.

## How To Find Cheap TrueBlue Awards

### 1. Go to [AwardFares](https://awardfares.com/signup)

It's optional to create an account, but it's also free, and it gives you access to more features. Make sure to [sign up for one here](https://awardfares.com/signup).

### 2. Select **TrueBlue** under *Frequent Flyer Program*

Tap on the **Loyalty Program** field and select JetBlue TrueBlue in the dropdown menu.

### 3. Add a Route

Use the **Origin** and **Destination** fields to add one (or more) airports to search for flights between those locations. AwardFares will search for award flights with any number of stops. In addition, you can use the **Stops** filter to search for non-stop flights only.

In the example below, we search for flights [between Amsterdam and Paris to New York](https://awardfares.com/search?area:NYC.area:CDG.;so:a;z:delta).

### 4. Choose or explore dates

If you have a particular date in mind, add it by tapping on the **Calendar** field.

If you don't have a set date, you can take advantage of AwardFare's **Timeline View** to explore seat availability across different days. The Timeline View displays how many seats are available for each day of the week/month. The bars are color-coded, so it's easy to distinguish between cabin classes (Economy, Business, First). You can also trigger new searches by tapping the refresh icon underneath each day.

In addition, you can tap anywhere on the flight to display more details in an expanded view, such as aircraft type, and even [get the current seat maps](https://blog.awardfares.com/seatmaps-guide/) to see which seats are free versus occupied!

### 5. Sort by Price

Whether you are exploring dates using the Timeline View or have selected a specific day, AwardFares will show you the available seats (with real-time data) within seconds in the result list below.

You can tap on the different header columns to sort the results by price. Use the **Eco**, **Prem**, **Biz**, and **First** class tags to find cheap awards across multiple dates, itineraries, and airlines.

### 6. Book on Air France Website

One of the slightly confusing parts of Flying Blue as a loyalty program is that they have multiple portals, both through Air France and KLM's website.

Once you have identified the flight(s) you want, tap on the **Book** button, and AwardFares will redirect you to Air France website, setting your query directly, so you don't have to redo the search. Simply login and complete the booking<sup>1</sup>.

 - *(1) Remember that AwardFares will never ask for the login credentials of any of your frequent flyer programs to work.*
