Aeroplan has more airline partners than any other program, and that’s good news for flyers trying to score a flight in first class. Getting a first-class award ticket is a great way to live the full experience without spending tens of thousands of dollars on the full-fare ticket. Aeroplan, then, with so many partners onboard, comes across as one of the best ways to get a first-class award ticket in 2023.

But searching for those tickets is generally hard and tricky: only a few seats are available, and many are released last minute. In addition, even if you see space available, how do you know it is a good redemption for your miles? How can you search for **good awards** without spending hours doing so?

In this guide, we cover a step-by-step guide on how to find good first-class redemption for your Aeroplan miles using our tool AwardFares.



## How To Search For First Class Awards Using Aeroplan Miles


### 1. Create an AwardFares account and log-in

Go to AwardFares’ sign-up page and create an account. You’ll need to enter an email address and a password.

### 2. Select Aeroplan as your Frequent Flyer Program

On AwardFares homepage, you will see a Frequent Flyer Program Picker (FFP). Tap on it and select **Aeroplan**. This will only perform searches and show you award seats available using Aeroplan miles.

### 3. Filter out by First Class cabin

Now, under **Cabin**, select **First Class** **Only**. This will remove all other cabins, such as Economy, Premium Economy, and Business, and just show you seats available in First Class.

### 4. Select Origin and Destination

If you already have your departure and destination city, you can add those under the "**Where from?**" and “**Where to?**" fields. Once you do so, you will be able to see the Timeline view with all available awards per day.

### 5. Perform a broad search.

If you have flexibility on the routes, AwardFares is powerful as Google Flights. It lets you explore options available by performing what we call **broad searches**. You can see available flights by selecting only departure, arrival city, or regions. For example, you can explore all flights from [**Europe** to the **United States**](https://awardfares.com/search?zone:Europe.country:US.;c:first;z:aeroplan) by simply typing those regions.


### 6. Filter out by Airline

If you are interested in a particular airline, you can tap the **Airline** filter and select it. This allows you to see only flights on, for example, Lufthansa, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, ANA, or others.

### 7. Confirm availability on Aeroplan’s website

Once you have selected the options, you can double-check the availability on Aeroplan’s website with your own account, searching for the exact same flights and dates you found using AwardFares.

You can compare the mileage requirements and fees for different flights and airlines and then determine the best redemptions for your desired dates and destinations.

**Pro tip:** Keep in mind that off-peak pricing and lower fuel surcharges can save you both miles and money.


### 8. Optional: Set up alerts

If you don’t see available seats on a given flight and date you are interested, don’t worry. Seat availability changes daily, as airlines release those seats on short notice. 

AwardFares has an alert feature that monitors the flights you want and notifies you via email once/if they become available.

To set up an Alert, just tap on **Alerts** > **Add Alert** > and fill out the required information such as route, dates, passengers, cabin.
