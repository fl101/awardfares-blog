After a series of strikes that hit hard, Lufthansa is ready to share some exciting news for long-haul travelers. Lufthansa's new premium travel experience, Allegris, takes off on May 1st, 2024.

The first route will depart from Munich, Germany, towards the beautiful Canadian city of Vancouver. Toronto will soon follow, with alternating service between the two destinations in the initial months. As Lufthansa receives more Airbus A350s equipped with the Allegris cabin, Chicago and Montreal will be added to the summer schedule.

Travelers already booked on these flights will be automatically upgraded to the new Allegris cabin. According to Lufthansa's announcement, selecting your seat in Business Class is completely free for a limited time.

Keep in mind that confirmation of whether a specific flight offers the Allegris experience will be available three weeks before departure.

## No seats available? Get notified with Alerts

It is very common that airlines, when a new product or service is introduced, limit the number of seats released as awards, or even don't release any seat at all at the beginning. No worries, patience is key, but we are here to help.

AwardFares let you set up alerts in an easy way, tracking your desired flights, and notifying you via email when seats open up. For example, as of today, there are no seats available on the inaugural flight from Munich (MUC) to Vancouver (YVR):

To set up a new alert for this flight, tap on the **Track** button and turn on the toggle.

A popup will display *Alert Created*, and you will be able to see the newly created alert under the **Alerts** pane (top bar).

It's also possible to edit the alert by tapping on the *edit* icon (pencil). For example, if you want to adjust the date, cabin, set up a wide search (for +-1 day) or set a max price.
