After a series of strikes that hit hard, Lufthansa is ready to share some exciting news for long-haul travelers. Lufthansa's new premium travel experience, Allegris, takes off on May 1st, 2024.

The first route will depart from Munich, Germany, towards the beautiful Canadian city of Vancouver. Toronto will soon follow, with alternating service between the two destinations in the initial months. As Lufthansa receives more Airbus A350s equipped with the Allegris cabin, Chicago and Montreal will be added to the summer schedule.

You can now view seat maps for all Allegris flights departing May 1st onwards through Lufthansa's regular booking channels. This includes all the special Allegris seating options, like the five unique business class configurations.

Travelers already booked on these flights will be automatically upgraded to the new Allegris cabin. According to Lufthansa's announcement, for a limited time, selecting your seat in Business Class is completely free.

Keep in mind that confirmation of whether a specific flight offers the Allegris experience will be available three weeks before departure.
