Delta Air Lines is making it easier for people to visit warm places in Latin America and the Caribbean by increasing its flights from Atlanta, New York-JFK, and Minneapolis/St. Paul. The airline will start flying to new places like Barbados, Puerto Plata, Mazatlán, and will fly more often to Curaçao.

In this post, we use AwardFares to have a look at the award availability in these new routes with [Delta SkyMiles](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:delta). Keep in mind that, as a SkyTeam partner, it's also possible to find seats on these routes using [Flying Blue](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:flyingblue).

## More Choices for Travelers

[Delta confirmed](https://news.delta.com/discover-more-sunshine-delta-new-routes-barbados-puerto-plata-mazatlan-and-more-flights-curacao) that is working hard to connect travelers from Atlanta and all over the US to their favorite vacation spots without hassle. The airline plans to offer around **1,000 flights every week** to various unique locations in Latin America and the Caribbean. By next winter, Delta will fly to 50 cities in these areas, making it easy for people to get to these places from nearly 200 cities around the world.

## New Destinations

### 1. Barbados

Starting November 23, Delta will have daily flights from Atlanta to Barbados and flights from New York-JFK on Saturdays starting December 21. Visitors can enjoy the island’s beaches, food, and history.

This is probably the hardest route to book with miles. So far, we've only seen seats on December 28th. They might release more as time passes.
