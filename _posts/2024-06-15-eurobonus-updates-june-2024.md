- **Important**: If you cancel or downgrade the card within 12 months of being granted, your account will be debited with the value of your received welcome bonus. This prevents people from applying, getting the bonus, and canceling before the entire year.

### 3. Announcement on 2 for 1 Vouchers / Companion Tickets

American Express has now officially informed about the upcoming changes to the 2 for 1 benefit once SAS transitions from Star Alliance to SkyTeam.
