Austrian Airlines introduced a new direct flight connecting Vienna Airport (VIE) to Boston Logan International Airport (BOS). This significant addition, set to start in the summer, establishes the first nonstop link between Boston and the Austrian capital. The service, beginning July 1, will operate between five to six times weekly, enriching the travel choices for those looking to explore Vienna or venture further into Europe.

## Why Boston?

This initiative is a part of Lufthansa Group's strategy to enhance its network, making Boston's Logan International Airport a crucial hub for transatlantic journeys. Notably, Austrian Airlines will join its group counterparts, Lufthansa and Swiss, in serving the Boston market, further solidifying the airport's status as a key gateway for international travel.

## Operation & Schedule

Austrian Airlines will deploy its Boeing 767-300ER aircraft for the Boston-Vienna route, accommodating 211 passengers across three classes: Business, Premium Economy, and Economy. A highlight of the travel experience on this route is the airline's unique "Flying Chef" program in the business class, where passengers can enjoy meals crafted onboard by chefs, complemented by wine pairings suggested by sommeliers.
