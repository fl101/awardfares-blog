On a recent trip between Tokyo and the US west coast I had the opportunity to try ZIPAIR for the first time. The airline is a low-cost carrier owned by Japan Airlines (JAL). However, what makes ZIPAIR extra interesting (compared to other LCCs) is that they offer premium seating options with full-flat "Business class" seats.

Be aware that ZIPAIR full-flat is *really* popular, so be sure to book your tickets in advance. On the NRT-SFO most full-flat seats are sold out up to 2 months in advance!

## Booking

Now, this is not a real Business class product like you'd expect on a full-service carrier. On ZIPAIR you are only paying for the upgraded seat, and many of the things you'd normally take for granted are *not* included in a ZIPAIR ticket, such as seat selection, inflight meal, checked baggage, or lounge access. Even pillows and blankets are not included, and the seat does not have any built-in IFE (more on that later).

When booking your ticket, you can choose to individually add-on any extra services that you need, or you can buy one of the service packages. I bought the Premium package (which was around US$100). I was glad I did this, because the amenity set comes with a nice blanket (which I kept as a souvenir) and a surprisingly comfortable inflatable pillow.

Given that ZIPAIR prices are much cheaper than the competition (in some cases half the price), it's actually a really great option if you just want a good night's sleep on a red-eye or long-haul flight.

## Check-In

ZIPAIR check-in is available at T1 North Wing at Narita. The first step was to print my boarding pass in the automated machine. Then, the staff swiftly directed me to the Self Bag Drop area, which had a very short queue. Be sure to adhere to the bag count and weight limits, since all bags were thoroughly checked before entering the bag drop area. Once at the front, checking in my bag was an easy and very efficient process.

Security and immigration was, as usual, very efficient as well, so I was through to air-side within a couple of minutes.

## Lounge

None of the ZIPAIR tickets or service packages include lounge access, instead they offer it as an add-on for 5,700 JPY for the NARITA PREMIER LOUNGE (I would definitely spend my money elsewhere).

Instead, I decided to try the NOA lounge, which I was able to access with my Priority Pass. The lounge experience was very subpar, offering only a very limited set of drinks and small snacks. Even the cups were paper, which felt very basic.

Since it was approaching dinner time, I opted to leave the lounge and head over to the air-side IPPUDO ramen restaurant instead, which was definitely worth paying for.

## Boarding

I spent the rest of the time just hanging out near the gate area. Boarding started with pre-boarding for anyone who needed assistant, followed by priority boarding for "Full-Flat" passengers. Although, this doesn't actually seem to be an official "perk".

## Cabin

In my opinion the cabin looks great, I really like the black and white color scheme. The highlight of course is the 1-2-1 full-flat seating, where every seat as direct aisle access.

</figure>

## Seat

Even though this at first glance looks like a true Business class seat, it is not. The biggest difference you'll notice is the lack of any IFE screen. Instead you'll have to rely on bringing your own entertainment or stream from the inflight WiFi.

<figure>

<img src="/assets/img/zipair-business-nrt-sfo/seat3.jpg" />
</figure>

The seat itself however felt premium, and was just as comfortable as any of the best Business class products I've tried. It also comes with a power outlet, a USB charging port, and all the controls you need to adjust the seat and lighting.

One thing to note is that there is a row of 4 lavatories right behind the last row of Full-Flat seats. So, when choosing your seat you'd probably be best to try to avoid this row, especially since all lavatories are shared among all passengers (there are no dedicated lavatories for "Full-Flat" passengers).

## Service

As you'd expect with any Low Cost Carrier, the service is polite, but very minimal, even for Full-Flat passengers. They were available to call if you needed anything, but other than that they stayed in the galley. I don't necessarily view this as a bad thing though, since sometimes you just want to keep to yourself, and not have any distractions or interruptions, especially on a night flight.

## IFE and WiFi

As mentioned, there is no IFE screen at your seat. Instead, you'll have to connect to the inflight WiFi service, which gives you access to internet (for free), shopping, and (some) entertainment.

I rarely use the IFE anyways, but I do like to use it the view the map. Fortunately a map is available on the inflight WiFi.

As for movies, the selection was rather small, but at least some fairly recent options were available to stream.

As mentioned, internet access is free, which is a fantastic perk. It was easy to connect to and worked well for messaging.

## Amenities

As expected, there is no complimentary amenity kit. Also, the seat does not come with any pillow or blanket (something you might assume would be provided). Instead, you have to option to buy a blanket, pillow, and other amenities.

Since pre-purchased the Premium package when booking my ticket, I received a ZIPAIR branded blanket, which was very soft and something I've kept and still use! Slippers, earplugs, and a blow-up pillow. The pillow was surprisingly comfortable, and worked amazingly well if you're a side-sleeper wearing headphones thanks to the donut shaped design. I'm not sure if that was the intention or not.

## Shopping, Food, and Drinks

There are no complementary food or drinks offered onboard. Instead you'll have to pre-order your meal when booking your ticket, bring your own food, or buy onboard. One important thing to be aware of is that the buy onboard service was only available during certain hours, so if you need to buy anything for later make sure to do it when the service is available!

You'll also see that if you need a cup, that's something you'll have to pay for as well, albeit very cheap (10 JPY = $0,06).

The Premium packaged included a meal, where I chose the Gyudon (beef rice bowl). It was served around 1.5 hours into the flight. Overall it was "ok" but nothing special.

I think the best recommendation is to bring your own food and drinks onboard with you. There is a 7-11 air-side at Narita T1, so I'd recommend grabbing some essentials there before the flight.

## ZIPAIR Point Club

ZIPAIR has their own loyalty program called "Point Club". You earn points by booking ZIPAIR flights, and you can redeem points when making purchases, 1 ZIPAIR point is worth 1 yen.

You can also link your JAL MileageBank account in order to convert to/from JAL Miles.
- 2 ZIPAIR Points => 1 JAL Mile
- 1 JAL Mile => 1-1.5 ZIPAIR Points (you get a better conversion rate when converting 10k+ JAL miles at once)

I earned 100 ZIPAIR Points for my NRT-SFO flight. It's not much, but better than nothing I guess!

## Summary

Overall I really enjoyed my ZIPAIR Full-Flat flight. I really love the idea of Low Cost Carriers offering premium seating options. Sometimes you just want a comfortable seat, at a lower cost, and you're willing to forego all the bells and whistles of a traditional Business class flight.

The cabin was great, the seat was very comfortable, and I was able to sleep very well during the flight. Also, the fact that they offer free WiFi to all passengers is a great perk!
