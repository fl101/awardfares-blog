## What is Cowtool? {#what-is-cowtool}

[Cowtool](https://cowtool.com) is a tool that provides information about fare classes and seat availability for different flights, and it has been particularly useful for Air Canada Aeroplan members to understand pricing, seat categories and upgrade opportunities.

The tool includes a feature known as "R space", which is represented as a boolean value (true/false). The term "R space" typically refers to a fare class that represents upgrade availability from economy to a higher class of service using miles or points.

The tool also uses codes to denote different cabin classes, such as "J" for business class, "PY" for premium economy, and "Y" for economy class. For example, users might see "9+ for Y" and "6 for J" indicating the number of seats that the airline is willing to sell in economy and business class respectively​1.

With a visually appealing and easy-to-understand interface, AwardFares is accessible to both beginners and experienced travellers. The platform is easy to navigate and simplifies the task of finding the best award flight deals. Users can set notifications for particular routes and airlines, and the system automatically alerts them when a good deal pops up.

Cowtool, on the other hand, offers a more data-centric interface that is assumes users to be frequent flyers who are comfortable navigating complex information. Its highly detailed information makes it a comprehensive tool for seasoned award travelers, but the steep learning curve makes it hard for beginners.



### 2. Functionality and Features {#features}


AwardFares excels in its ability to provide real-time updates on available award seats across a wide range of airlines, specifically focusing on business and first-class award spaces. It allows users to easily check award seat availability and potential costs, making it a valuable tool for those looking to optimize their premium travel experiences.

The search results on AwardFares are presented clearly, making it easy to compare options and identify the best opportunities for booking award flights.

One of the biggest advantages of AwardFares is the possibility to search across entire regions, like whole countries or continents. In a matter of seconds, search results pop up with available award flights to different destinations within that region.

Unlike Cowtool, where filtering down the options require new searches, filters on AwardFares are also one click away. From the dropdown menus, it’s possible to trim down results based on frequent flyer program, airline, number of passengers, number of stops, or equipment type.

Another convenient feature on AwardFares is the possibility to set up alerts for award seat availability directly from the search results. 


Cowtool shines in its depth of data and information. The platform offers a comprehensive database of airlines and their award seat availability. Moreover, it provides detailed breakdowns of redemption rates, transfer partners, and stopover rules for aeroplan. This depth of information makes Cowtool particularly useful for those who want a more in-depth understanding of the reward landscape.

Cowtool offers a collection of five very-targed tools for Air Canada flyers and Aeroplan members.

* **AC Reward Searcher**. Unofficial tool for searching Aeroplan flight redemptions. It allows searching multiple dates, origins, and destinations, and has extremely advanced filtering to help you find the perfect itinerary. You must be signed in to use this.
* **Air Canada (AC) PNR Viewer**. Unofficial tool for viewing a PNR. It shows all pertinent data about your PNR in a concise format.
* **Air Canada Schedule Change Notifier**. Unofficial tool to notify you have AC schedule changes. It looks for any AC operated and many AC marketed flights in your TripIt account that have times or aircraft types that are different than what's currently on AC's schedule, and sends an email if it finds anything.
* **Air Canada SQD/SQM Calculator**. Unofficial AC SQD/SQM calculator. Built by various FlyerTalkers using a database of crowd-sourced distances for numerous city pairs, it will tell you exactly how much SQD/SQM you'll earn, per segment, for any itineraries you can come up with. This is also the same code that the PNR Viewer uses to determine the SQD/SQM breakdowns.
* **Air Canada Flight Status**. View flight status, seat maps, menus, and departure/arrival information. Some information is only available as departure time gets closer.

Cowtool, on the other hand, doesn't provide a mobile version.

### 5. Customer Support: One tap to reach AwardFares’ support {#customer-support}
