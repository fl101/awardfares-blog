SAS just launched a [discounted offer for EuroBonus members](https://www.sas.se/special-offers/poangrabatt/): **25% discount on award flights to/from Paris, London, Amsterdam, Gdansk, Poznan, Brussels and Manchester**. This promotion is applicable to flights on SAS Go Bonus, and SAS Plus Bonus.

One thing to highlight is the possibility to combine the discount with the FlyPremium benefit (for holders of the SAS Mastercard).
