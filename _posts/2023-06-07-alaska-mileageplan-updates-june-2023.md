## [Seattle to Paris](https://awardfares.com/search?SEA.CDG.;a:TN;z:alaska#) on Air Tahiti Nui {#air-tahiti}

Connect in Seattle and go straight to Paris via a direct flight on Air Tahiti Nui. Redemptions are already visible on AwardFares.

Air Tahiti Nui upgraded its fleet to Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2018, which are named after the islands of French Polynesia. The airline is known for its commitment to Tahitian culture, often showcasing traditional music and dance during flights, and serves a unique blend of French and Polynesian cuisine. Air Tahiti Nui is the only carrier that flies non-stop between Los Angeles and Tahiti, a key route that has won it numerous travel industry awards for best airline in the South Pacific.
