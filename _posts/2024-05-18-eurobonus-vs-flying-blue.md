The recent announcement of [Air France-KLM’s acquisition of SAS](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-acquisition/) has raised many questions for current EuroBonus members. As the loyalty landscapes merge, many (including us at AwardFares) are re-evaluating whether to remain with **EuroBonus** or transition to **Flying Blue**.

This post aims to provide a detailed comparison between the two programs, highlighting key differences and considerations that could influence your decision in this new era of airline alliances.

## Overview of EuroBonus: Understanding the New Context

[**EuroBonus**](https://www.sas.se/eurobonus/home/), traditionally Scandinavian Airlines' loyalty program, now falls under a broader umbrella due to the Air France-KLM acquisition and the transition to SkyTeam. This development could expand EuroBonus's horizons with different integrated services and benefits.

**Key Features:**

- **Airline Partners**: Part of Star Alliance until September 1st, 2024.
- **Point Earning**: Members earn points based on the fare and the flight length.
- **Point Redemption**: Points can be used to book new flights, upgrade seats, or shop in the EuroBonus shop.

## Overview of Flying Blue

[**Flying Blue**](https://www.flyingblue.com/) is the official frequent flyer program for Air France, KLM, and several other subsidiary airlines. It is known for its flexibility in earning and spending miles and its range of elite status benefits. Flying Blue also collaborates with SkyTeam alliance members, broadening the scope for accumulating and redeeming miles.

**Key Features:**

- **Airline Partners**: Includes all SkyTeam members, offering a comprehensive network of global destinations.
- **Mile Earning**: Miles are earned based on the amount spent on tickets rather than the distance flown.

## Which Program is Best?

Finding the perfect travel rewards program can feel overwhelming, but don't worry! There's no one-size-fits-all answer, as the best program depends on your individual travel habits. Factors like how often you fly, where you go, and your spending habits all play a role.

In this section, we'll break down both programs across several key areas to help you make an informed decision.

### Based on Money Spent and Distance Flown

This table helps you choose the best program for earning points/miles, considering both how much you spend (economy vs. premium fares) and how far you fly (short vs. long-haul).

The point of this assessment is to compare the different types of award charts for various types of travel: Flying Blue's chart is dynamic and centered on money spent on the ticket, while SAS EuroBonus considers both distance and fare class.

|                         | **Ultra-low Fares**          | **Medium/Regular Fares**   | **Business Class/Premium Fares** |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Short-Haul**          | Flying Blue                | Flying Blue                | SAS EuroBonus                |
| **Medium-Haul**         | Flying Blue                | SAS EuroBonus              | SAS EuroBonus                |
| **Long-Haul**           | SAS EuroBonus              | SAS EuroBonus              | SAS EuroBonus                |

**Some Thoughts**

For ultra-low fares (Basic Economy and Deals):

- Short-Haul: Flying Blue might be better as even low spending can accumulate meaningful miles.
- Medium-Haul and Long-Haul: Flying Blue is more beneficial on medium-haul due to spending-based accumulation, but for long-haul flights, the increased distance makes SAS EuroBonus slightly better due to its distance-based earning, which becomes significant over long distances.

For standard fares (spending average prices)

- Short-Haul: Flying Blue continues to perform well here due to its spending-based rewards.
- Medium-Haul and Long-Haul: As ticket prices and distances increase, SAS EuroBonus becomes more advantageous because its combination of distance and fare class potentially yields more points.

For Premium Fares

- Short-Haul: SAS EuroBonus tends to offer better value as the high fare class combined with even short distances earns a substantial number of points.
- Medium-Haul and Long-Haul: SAS EuroBonus strongly outperforms in these categories due to higher multipliers for more expensive fare classes and longer distances flown.

### Based on Home Country and Destinations

Next, let's see how program benefits vary by your home country and travel plans. We'll consider factors like co-branded credit cards, regional promotions, and how valuable miles/points are for redemptions in specific areas. This will help you decide which program offers the most value for your travel preferences.

| **Home Country/Destination** | **Flying Blue**                                         | **SAS EuroBonus**                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scandinavia (Home)**       | Good for flights to/from Europe; limited credit cards   | Best option; extensive credit card options, optimal for regional travel within Scandinavia |
| **Europe (Home)**            | Best option; numerous credit card options, excellent for intra-European flights | Good, especially for travel to/from Scandinavia         |
| **Europe to Asia**           | Excellent; strong network via partners, beneficial for flights to Asia | Good; benefits from Star Alliance network               |
| **Europe to Americas**       | Excellent; offers robust rewards for transatlantic flights, especially via Air France and KLM | Good; Star Alliance benefits but fewer direct options than Flying Blue |
| **North America (Home)**     | Best; extensive partner airlines, multiple credit card options | Limited; less advantageous due to fewer direct flights and partners |
| **Asia (Home)**              | Good; strong partnerships with Asian airlines, good redemption options | Limited; fewer direct connections compared to Flying Blue |

**Key Points**

- **Scandinavia as Home Country**: SAS EuroBonus undoubtedly wins here. It is tailored to the needs of Scandinavian travelers, offering extensive local benefits, credit card options, and promotions. Redemption options within Scandinavia and Europe are particularly valuable.
- **Europe as Home Country**: Flying Blue generally offers greater flexibility and benefits for European members, with a wide range of airline and non-airline partners across the continent.
- **Long-Distance Flights (Europe to Asia/Americas)**: Flying Blue tends to be more advantageous due to its strong connections with Air France and KLM, which have extensive networks in these regions. Additionally, Flying Blue often runs promotions that enhance mile earning and redemption on these routes.
- **North America and Asia as Home Countries**: Flying Blue offers more benefits due to its extensive network of partner airlines and more frequent direct flights to various destinations in Europe. Additionally, the availability of co-branded credit cards in these regions makes accruing and redeeming miles more accessible and lucrative.

### Based on Status

EuroBonus and Flying Blue both reward frequent flyers with tiered memberships, offering a path to unlock valuable perks and accelerate your points/miles accumulation. Earning your way up the tiers can bring exciting benefits like priority boarding, lounge access, and even free flight upgrades. The key difference between the programs lies in how you qualify for these tiers. EuroBonus uses a combination of the amount you spend and the fare class you choose, while Flying Blue focuses primarily on the total amount spent on your tickets.

## What if SAS EuroBonus Gets Replaced by Flying Blue?

As expected during major shifts, there are rumors and speculation that in the future, SAS EuroBonus might be ditched or shut down, with Flying Blue replacing it. There's usually very little point behind speculating, but here are some insights in case that happens, based on what has happened historically with other airline mergers or acquisitions.

1. **Integration into Flying Blue**: Members of EuroBonus might have their accounts and points transferred to Flying Blue. This means a new set of rules for earning and redeeming points, and a different network of destinations and services.
2. **Status Alignment**: The transition could involve mapping EuroBonus membership tiers to corresponding Flying Blue levels. This might affect how quickly members can earn status and the benefits associated with each tier.
3. **Changes to Benefits and Perks**: This may mean new partnerships with hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services. In addition, co-branded credit cards will be adjusted, for example, in countries with SAS co-branded cards.

Historically, several notable mergers and acquisitions have led to the integration of airline loyalty programs:

- **Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines**: After Delta acquired Northwest in 2008, Northwest’s WorldPerks program was absorbed into Delta’s SkyMiles program. The transition involved transferring WorldPerks member balances to SkyMiles and aligning benefits under the SkyMiles framework.
- **United Airlines and Continental Airlines**: When United merged with Continental in 2010, Continental’s OnePass program was merged into United’s MileagePlus. Members of OnePass saw their accounts transitioned to MileagePlus, with efforts made to match tier statuses and balance points.
- **American Airlines and US Airways**: After their merger in 2013, US Airways’ Dividend Miles program was eventually integrated into American’s AAdvantage program. This included a comprehensive transition plan for transferring miles and aligning elite status levels.
