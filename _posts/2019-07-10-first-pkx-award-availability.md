With the opening of Beijing Daxing airport (PKX) LOT Polish Airlines is the first Star Alliance member offering award availability to the new airport. Starting on October 28 they will be moving 4 of their 7 weekly flights from Beijing Capital (PEK) to Beijing Daxing (PKX).

Both economy and business awards are currently available on the outbound and inbound flights (LO89 and LO90).

However, United MileagePlus is currently the only frequent flyer program that shows award availability on the new route.

These flights can probably be booked through other frequent flyer programs as well (they likely haven't updated their airport databases yet). For example, SAS EuroBonus shows the following when searching for PKX:

Air China has also announced that they will be serving the new airport, but only with domestic routes. So far there doesn't seem to be any award availability for these routes yet.
