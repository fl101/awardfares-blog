We are happy to announce that now it is possible to perform searches with AwardFares **without** and account! Previously, users needed to register to the platform to be able use the tool.

The newly introduced anonymous search functionality lets users test out AwardFares search engine, visualizing cached results, without the need to create an account or registering.

The search is limited to one frequent flyer program and displays results as a list. To apply filters such as airlines, cabins, stops, or use the Map/Journey features, users still need to log-in.

In addition, we added a 24h free trial period of our premium tiers, which is a great way to get familiar with all the features before committing. 
 

## How to try AwardFares without an account

1. Go to [AwardFares Search](https://awardfares.com/search).
2. Select your Frequent Flyer Program.
3. Choose **Origin** and **Destination** city or area.
4. Done!

AwardFares will show you the available seats both in Timeline view and as a list. The anonymous mode also works when performing broad searches (e.g. [Europe to United States](https://awardfares.com/search?zone:Europe.country:US.)).
