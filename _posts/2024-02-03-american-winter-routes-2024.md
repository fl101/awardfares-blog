American Airlines just announced an expansion to its flight schedule introducing new services, including a notable route to Brisbane, Australia (BNE), starting in October, using the Boeing 787-9 aircraft equipped with Flagship Suite seats. This expansion also includes the launch of flights to Veracruz, Mexico (VER), further broadening its already massive domestic and short-haul international network. The airline will also resume its service to Kona, Hawaii (KOA) from its Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) hub.

Tickets will be on sale starting Monday, February 5th, hence we see no available flights in AwardFares. We'll keep this post updated as the first seats appear.
