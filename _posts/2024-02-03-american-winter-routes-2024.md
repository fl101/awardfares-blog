## American Airlines Winter Schedule 2024: What's New?

### Direct Flights to Brisbane

Starting in October, American Airlines will offer direct flights from DFW to Brisbane, providing passengers with access to one of Australia's most vibrant cities. This service is part of a broader initiative to connect passengers to over 100 U.S. destinations with only one stop, making it easier to explore Brisbane's renowned coastlines, cultural scenes, and zoological parks.

### Expanded Network with Qantas

The airline's partnership with Qantas enhances its service offerings, allowing for a more comprehensive network between the United States and the South Pacific. This collaboration enables travelers to reach almost 70 destinations across Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific, alongside more than 200 U.S. destinations.
