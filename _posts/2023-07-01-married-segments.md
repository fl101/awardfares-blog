Let's try to find an award flight from Amsterdam (AMS) to Tokyo (NRT/HND). Our first attempt searching AMS-HND/NRT unfortunately doesn't yield any results.

The next thing to do would be to try some alternative origin airports in Europe. For example, let's see what we find if we search VIE to HND/NRT instead.

Oh, lots of business availability here. From this it looks like there **should** be plenty of award availability on the Lufthansa flight from FRA to HND (LH716) and one seat on the SWISS flight from ZRH to NRT (LX160).

So, let's see what happens if we try to find these direct flights.

No direct flights found. Why didn't the direct flights show up? Well, the answer is, these are **married segments**. I.e. the award seats on the Tokyo bound flights are only available **if** they are booked together with another segment. They cannot be booked by themselves.

In this case it looks like the awards are only available together with Austrian segments, i.e. originating from VIE on an Austrian airlines flight.

So how can we deal with this? Well, we can't split the married segments, so let's try to work it into our route instead by trying to find a suitable connecting flight to one of these married segments.

Let's go with the VIE-ZRH-NRT option, since it only requires 1 extra stop. First we click the "plus" icon to the right of this flight to add it to our journey.

Next we click "Add Flight" above the VIE-NRT flight to start searching for a suitable connecting flight that can take us from AMS to VIE.

Note that the VIE-ZRH flight leaves very early in the morning (06:15), so we will definitely need to add an overnight layover in VIE. Let's try to find a flight from AMS to VIE the day before (Jan 25th).

Lucky for us, there is a direct flight from AMS-VIE in the evening of Jan 25. So let's go ahead and add that to our journey. *(Make sure your layovers are max 24 hours, otherwise the routing will be invalid.)*

There we go. Now we have successfully built an award flight from AMS to NRT, via VIE and ZRH, with an overnight stop in VIE. Perhaps not ideal, but if you're really looking to use your miles then this might be an option worth considering.

So how do we book it? Well, since this routing didn't show up when searching AMS to NRT, that means that the SAS EuroBonus award search engine did not find this route automatically (likely because of the required overnight layover in VIE). We can confirm this by searching on the SAS website, where the business class route does not show up.

Therefore, you won't be able to book it online. Instead you'll have to call to the SAS EuroBonus award booking service and explain that you'd like to book this particular routing.

You could for example start by asking for a flight from VIE to NRT on Jan 26th, and confirm that they were able to find the married segment via ZRH. Then ask if it would be possible to add an extra segment before this flight, from AMS to VIE on Jan 25th.

Assuming the customer support agent is willing to do this, and there are no other restrictions for this particular routing, it should be possible to book. If the agent isn't willing to do this, then HUACA (hang up and call again)!

I hope that helps clarify some of the details around married segments, and how to work with them. Good luck!
