Lufthansa [announced that they will be adding 10 new routes in 2023](https://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/newsroom/releases/finance/lufthansa-5200-connections-more-to-205-destinations-in-summer-2023.html), expanding the airline route networks from Frankfurt and Munich. These new routes will put Lufthansa right behind its pre-pandemic route numbers. Flight operations from both hubs will reach a whopping 5200 per week! (87% of its pre-COVID-19 levels).

These new routes are a sign of how confident Lufthansa is in the recovery of air travel. The airline is also investing in new aircraft, including the Airbus A350-900 and the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.

The good news is that you can already see the **new routes on AwardFares**, through many of the frequent flyer programs we love (like SAS EuroBonus, United MileagePlus, etc.).
