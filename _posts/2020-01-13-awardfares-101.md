## Award Search / Custom Searches
Gold and Diamond users can search all routes and dates. Enter up to 6 airport codes and choose the dates you want to check. Either select a single date, or click the *search icon* under each date you want to search in the timeline. If the timeline isn't visible, simply click the *Timeline* toggle. You can of course search multiple dates at once!
