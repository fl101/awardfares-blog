Traveling on points and miles is a fantastic way to experience the world, but finding award availability can feel like deciphering ancient scrolls. That's where award search tools come in. AwardFares is one of the easiest ways to search for your next free flight using points or miles. With a few clicks, you can search and gather helpful information without logging in to your frequent flyer account or dealing with slow award search portals. AwardFares's modern user interface allows search availability across multiple frequent flyer programs, set up alerts, look at seat maps, and plan journeys in a few minutes.

In a similar way, [seats.aero](https://seats.aero/) is a web-based search tool specifically designed to help frequent flyers find award availability on various airlines and mileage programs. It excels at searching for award seats on long-haul international flights. While both platforms have their competitive edges, there are specific differences worth mentioning.

## What is seats.aero?

[**seats.aero**](https://seats.aero/) is a web-based search tool specifically designed to help frequent flyers find award availability on various airlines and mileage programs. It's renowned for its advanced search functionalities, allowing users to fine-tune searches with great detail, including searching +/- days, specifying the number of seats, and filtering by cabin class. Its alert system is versatile, offering regular alerts for specific routes and dates, and cabin alerts for broader searches. Additionally, seats.aero includes tools like the Air Canada eUpgrade Finder. However, it does assume a certain level of expertise from its users and might not cover all routes or mileage programs, notably missing Avios and Cathay Asia Miles​.
