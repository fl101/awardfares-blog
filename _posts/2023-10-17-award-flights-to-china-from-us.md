## Current Status: Flights Between United States and China {#situation}

As of October 2023, direct flights between the United States and China are still limited due to a complex geopolitical situation and COVID-19 restrictions that remain in place. This makes it extremely hard for travelers connecting between both countries to find good alternatives: th

However, there have been some recent developments that suggest that the number of flights may be increasing soon.

In August 2023, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) announced that it would allow Chinese airlines to increase the number of direct flights between the two countries to 24 per week, up from the previous limit of 12. The Chinese government has also agreed to reciprocate, meaning that US airlines will also be able to operate 24 direct flights per week to China.

This is a positive development, but it is still far from the pre-pandemic level of service. In 2019, there were over 300 direct flights per week between the US and China.


Despite these restrictions, there is a growing demand for direct flights between the US and China. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ease, it is likely that the number of flights will continue to increase.

Here are some of the airlines that currently offer direct flights between the US and China:

Air China
China Eastern Airlines
China Southern Airlines
United Airlines
Delta Air Lines
American Airlines
