The wait is over for SAS EuroBonus members.

The shift will impact how you earn and redeem points, but also opens doors to a whole new network of airlines.

Here's a breakdown of the key points.

## What happens to my EuroBonus membership?

Relax, your EuroBonus membership is safe! The program itself remains with SAS, and your current tier status and points won't be affected.

## Earning Points

* Until August 31st, 2024: Business as usual! You'll earn points on Star Alliance flights as per your membership level.
* From September 1st, 2024: You'll switch to earning points on flights with most SkyTeam airlines, not Star Alliance. Specific details on earning rates are still to come, but SAS promises information will be available soon on their EuroBonus partners page.

## Using Points

### Star Alliance Bookings

* You can still book award flights on Star Alliance airlines using your points until August 31st, even for travel after that date.
* No new Star Alliance award bookings will be possible after August 31st.
Existing Amex 2-for-1 vouchers can still be used for Star Alliance awards until August 31st.
* You can rebook existing Star Alliance awards (up to 24 hours before departure) until August 31st, even if your flight is after September 1st.
* Cancellations follow the same rules - up to 24 hours before departure.

### SkyTeam Bookings

* The good news! You can use your points to book award flights on most SkyTeam airlines from September 1st onwards.
* Amex 2-for-1 vouchers will also be valid for SkyTeam awards.
* Rebooking and cancellation rules for SkyTeam awards will mirror the existing Star Alliance policy (24 hours before departure).

### Rebooking on different airlines?

Something still not 100% clear to us is that "From 1 September 2024, you can rebook your Bonus trip to a SAS or certain SkyTeam airline flights (subject to availability)". For example, when having a trip booked on Star Alliance airlines, sounds it should be possible to rebook it on SkyTeam.

Another unclear thing is the possibility of mixed bookings Star Alliance + SkyTeam.

**Overall, this move opens doors to a new network of airlines (19 new ones to be exact) and over 1,000 additional destinations**. While some specifics are still being ironed out, SAS claims it is committed to making the transition smooth for EuroBonus members. Keep an eye on SAS's website and our blog for further updates as they become available.

In the meantime, this is a great opportunity to [explore using your points on Star Alliance airlines before the switch](https://blog.awardfares.com/eurobonus-star-alliance-awards/). Consider booking that dream trip you've been eyeing!
