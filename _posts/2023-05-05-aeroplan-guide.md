## What is Aeroplan?

[**Aeroplan**](https://aeroplan.com/) is Air Canada’s frequent flyer program (Canada’s largest airline). Members can earn miles through various activities, such as flying with Air Canada or its Star Alliance partners, using Aeroplan-affiliated credit cards, booking hotels and car rentals, shopping at participating retailers, and more. Miles can be redeemed for a wide range of rewards, including flights, hotel stays, car rentals, vacation packages, merchandise, and gift cards.

If you are curious like us, Aeroplan was originally launched in 1984 as a division of Air Canada and later became a separate company. In 2020, Air Canada reacquired Aeroplan and integrated it back into the airline's operations.

### How Much Are Aeroplan Miles Worth?

As with any other frequent flyer program, the value of Aeroplan miles varies greatly depending on how they are redeemed. As a general rule of thumb, Aeroplan miles are worth between 1.2 and 2.5 USD cents per mile when redeemed for flights, but this value is not fixed and can fluctuate based on various factors such as the route, cabin class, demand, and redemption type.

When redeeming miles for Business or First Class flights, you may get a higher value per mile compared to economy-class redemptions.

## Aeroplan Award Chart Sweet Spots

In 2021, Aeroplan has moved to a dynamic pricing model for its reward flights, which means that there isn't a fixed award chart with set redemption rates. This makes it more difficult to find good redemptions. However, there are still some sweet spots where you can get great value from your Aeroplan miles.

Here are ten examples of such routes:

### 1. [North America to Europe in Business Class](https://awardfares.com/search?continent:NA.zone:Europe.;c:business;z:aeroplan)

Look for flights with low taxes and fees, such as those operated by Swiss or Turkish Airlines. This can offer exceptional value for your miles, especially on longer routes.

### 7. [Short-haul flights within Europe](https://awardfares.com/search?zone:Europe.zone:Europe.;o:price;so:asc;z:aeroplan)

We typically don't recommend redeeming miles on short-haul flights, but during some weeks or seasons the cash fares can be incredibly high, and miles can helpy you save a ton of money. For short-haul flights on Star Alliance partners within Europe.
