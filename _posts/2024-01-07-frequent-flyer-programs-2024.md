It might be a great time to re-think your strategy and consider venturing into new programs to get more value out of your miles. As it can be overwhelming to choose the one that best suits your travel needs and preferences, in this blog post we cover some of our favorite frequent flyer programs and why you should consider them for 2024.

As a disclaimer, this list expresses AwardFares' team choices, and by no means is a comprehensive comparison of all programs that exists. The "best" frequent flyer program will depend on your individual travel habits and preferences. Consider factors such as your home airport, preferred airlines, and desired redemption options when choosing a program, as we did for this list.

## Top Frequent Flyer Programs in 2024 (Our Picks)

### 1. SAS EuroBonus (Scandinavian Airlines)

<img src="../assets/img/ffp-2024/eurobonus.webp" style="max-width:150px;width:100%" align="right" alt="SAS EuroBonus." class="noborder"/>

Still one of our favorites due to their high award availability and low devaluation of their points. [**SAS EuroBonus**](https://www.flysas.com/en/eurobonus/home/) delivers a seamless travel experience across the Nordic region and beyond.

While a [future shift to SkyTeam is pending](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-acquisition), the program currently enjoys the benefits of Star Alliance, further expanding travel options. Overall, EuroBonus offers a rewarding and versatile experience for travelers of all types.

**Pro tip:** Search for SAS EuroBonus awards using AwardFares. [Try here](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:sas).

Why it shines:

* Companion vouchers: The Amex 2-for-1 voucher (or companion ticket) gives the opportunity to fly amazing cabins such as Lufthansa First Class and others, at 50% of the price.
* Partners: Earn and redeem points on Star Alliance airlines, expanding your travel possibilities. We've tried many redemptions on EVA Air, ANA, Lufthansa, Austrian, Swiss, Copa, United, and more.
* Target Region: Scandinavia and Europe, with worldwide reach through Star Alliance.

[**JetBlue's TrueBlue**](https://www.jetblue.com/trueblue) program stands out with its customer-centric approach and simplicity. One of its primary strengths is the absence of blackout dates for award flights, a feature that sets it apart from many competitors and offers unparalleled flexibility for members. Points in the TrueBlue program are earned based on dollars spent rather than miles flown, which benefits passengers who purchase higher-priced tickets rather than those who fly longer distances.
