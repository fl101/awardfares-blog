Cabin type information is now available for certain flights. Most Singapore Airlines flights and some ANA flights will now display the type of cabin used for that particular flight, if the information is available. Note that this feature is only available to [Gold and Diamond members](https://awardfares.com/pricing).

## Singapore Airlines
The following cabin types are now displayed in AwardFares for Singapore Airline flights:

- 2017 Suites (w/ Suites)
- 2006 Suites (w/ Suites)
- 2013 First (w/o Suites)
- 2006 First (w/o Suites)
- 2018 Regional (w/o First)
- 2009 Regional (w/o First)
- 2017 Business (w/o First)
- 2013 Business (w/o First)
- 2006 Business (w/o First)

## ANA
We have manually added cabin information for ANA routes that have the new 2019-style cabin. Currently there are only two routes that are *guaranteed* to have the new cabin:

- LHR-HND / HND-LHR (777-300ER)
- NRT-HNL / HNL-NRT (A380-800)

The New York (JFK and EWR) route currently offers the new cabin on select departures. The Frankfurt (FRA) route is expected to receive the new cabin next year. We will keep the cabin information updated as more data becomes available. See below for tips on how to find out which cabin a specific flight uses.

## Google Flights
A useful tip is that you can also use Google Flights to quickly check what type of seating configuration is available on a specific flight. For example, searching Qatar Airways business class you will see "Individual suite" for QSuite cabins and "Lie-flat seat for the older cabins. This also works for British Airways' new World Club cabin and ANA's new cabin.

## Seat Map / ExpertFlyer
Another option is to check the aircraft seat map. Some airlines will let you view the seat map before making a reservation. Otherwise you can also use a free account on [ExpertFlyer](https://www.expertflyer.com) to check the seat configuration. Here is an example showing the seat map for ANA NRT-JFK (NH10) on two different dates. Left is new cabin. Right is old cabin.
