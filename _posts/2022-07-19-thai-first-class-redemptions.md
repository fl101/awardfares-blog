After a long break during the COVID-19 pandemic, [THAI First Class](https://www.thaiairways.com/en/book/offers/royal-first-class.page) redemptions are finally back to an increasing number of routes. The first route to receive First Class was the London route, back in April of 2022. Now, Tokyo is also available, and Osaka is coming in September 2022.

## Route Details

The route is operated by THAI's new Boeing 777-300ER featuring 8 First Class seats in a 1-2-1 configuration across two rows.

## Availability

THAI is only releasing 1 First Class redemption at a time per flight. Of the different frequent flyer programs that AwardFares supports, here is what we have learned:

- **United** generally seems to have good availability. You can find First Class redemptions on quite a few flights, especially if you search far in advance. With United you can book THAI redemptions, including First Class, up to **336 days in advance**.

- **Aeroplan** is showing some availability, although much less than United. Furthermore, Aeroplan is restricted to only showing THAI redemptions up to **180 days in advance**. For Aeroplan your best bet is to try to find last minute First Class redemptions, since the seats released 1 year in advance will likely already have been booked up.

- **SAS EuroBonus** does not offer any First Class search online, but from our experience we have noticed that it seems to match Aeroplan availability. For other cabins SAS EuroBonus is able to search availability up to **180 days in advance**.

- **Lifemiles** is currently not showing any THAI First Class availability. Although you can search other cabins up to **339 days in advance**.
