## Why Aeromexico Rewards?

[**Aeromexico Rewards**](https://www.aeromexico.com/en-us/aeromexico-rewards) offers an interesting and solid program for frequent flyers or those who crave flexibility in their travel rewards. Not only do points never expire, but you can earn them on everyday purchases in addition to flights with Aeromexico (at a rate of 8 points per dollar spent on the base fare). As you accumulate points and move up tiers in the program, you'll unlock perks like priority boarding, free checked bags, and access to exclusive airport lounges.

The real power comes in how you can redeem your points. Use them for flights on Aeromexico and partner airlines, snag upgrades to a more luxurious cabin, or craft dream vacations with Aeromexico packages. Since Aeromexico belongs to the SkyTeam alliance, you also have the potential to extend your reach and redeem points on flights with other member airlines, opening up a world of travel possibilities.
