Today, we woke up to some unexpected developments in the SAS EuroBonus saga. It appears that booking flights on United Airlines using EuroBonus points is no longer an option. Their system fails to display any itineraries that include United flights. These changes could be linked to the recent slowdowns observed in their search engine and are likely associated with the new partnership with Delta Air Lines and the intention to join SkyTeam.

Let's review what we know so far! If you have additional information, please make sure to share it with us.

**UPDATE Mar 1st, 2024**: Air France confirms that SAS will leave Star Alliance during Q2, 2024, joining SkyTeam immediately. There are still very little information regarding the implementation of the transition.

**UPDATE Feb 27th, 2024**: SAS confirms the issue with a note at the top of the EuroBonus booking portal.

## United Disappears from EuroBonus Bookings (What We Know)

Booking United flights directly through EuroBonus seems to be a thing of the past. While the official reason remains unclear, we can assume it's related to a change in the partnership dynamics.

### SAS Prioritizes Delta and JetBlue

For revenue tickets, SAS has been increasingly favoring connections with [Delta](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:delta) and [JetBlue](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:jetblue) over United. For example, on SAS' website, Delta Air Lines is now offered as the onward connection for many destinations, including Las Vegas, Denver, Minneapolis, Boston, New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles.

When SAS announced the new route to Atlanta, they also mentioned a tighter collaboration with Delta Air Lines for onward connections, and might be even more [if the airline joins SkyTeam soon](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-and-skyteam/).

Keep in mind that while these routes/itineraries are convenient, they do not accrue points in the EuroBonus programs yet, for the legs operated by Delta. Read more [in this post](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-route-to-atlanta/).

### Limited Options for Transatlantic Travel

The disappearance of United flights from the EuroBonus platform significantly narrows the choices for members looking to travel between Europe and the United States.

United Airlines has:

1. A large network
2. Good availability
3. Consistent award prices

This change means members must now look for alternatives within the Star Alliance network or consider other airlines not affiliated with the program, potentially at higher costs or less convenient schedules.

The lack of an apparent alternative for award bookings presents a significant challenge. Trips to the U.S. outside SAS's direct routes might become trickier to redeem points on.

### The Last Hurrah?

Our cached data indicates that the most recent EuroBonus redemption for a United flight was recorded yesterday morning. We still don't know whether this situation is temporary or permanent, but as of today, there are no available award seats on United.
