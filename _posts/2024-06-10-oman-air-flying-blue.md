## Business Class Experience Like First Class

Oman Air's Business Class is known for including features that rival some airline's First Class offerings. Here's what makes it feel so luxurious:

- **Spacious Seats**: On their Boeing 787 Dreamliners, they feature  "Apex Suites" in a 2-2-2 configuration. However, the window seats have a special privacy shield that creates a very separated feel, almost like a mini-pod. There's ample legroom, and when the seat reclines fully flat, it offers a comfortable sleeping surface with generous footroom – unlike some business class seats with cramped footwells.
- **Top-notch Amenities**: They provide plush cushions, blankets, and a mattress pad, making for a very comfortable sleeping experience.  The amenity kit includes luxurious touches like Amouage fragrance and Oman Air-branded water. Noise-canceling headphones and a personal touch screen entertainment system add to the premium feel.
- **Personalized Service**: Oman Air is known for its attentive cabin crew who provide turndown service for your seat and cater to your needs throughout the flight. The airline also offers a [VVIP experience (provided by Jetex)](https://www.omanair.com/en/tashreef-service-by-jetex) including a deluxe meet and greet, fast-track airport services, luxury car with chauffer, and lounge facilities.

AwardFares will redirect you to Air France’s website to complete your booking without the need to re-enter your search criteria, as it will be pre-populated. Note that Flying Blue does not have a centralized booking portal, so you'll need to book through either Air France or KLM website.
