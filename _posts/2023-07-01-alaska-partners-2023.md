Alaska Airlines has been rolling out a new search UI for Mileage Plan which currently does not support searching Business and First Class redemptions with partner airlines: it only works for Alaska Airlines. There are no known date or official statement from the airline for when this features will be back.

That's a significant setback. Mileage Plan can be one of the most convenient programs for booking premium cabins, as they have a great number of partner airlines beyond alliances. Recently [they added STARLUX airlines](https://blog.awardfares.com/alaska-mileageplan-updates-june-2023/), and they keep expanding. 

**But hey**, we have a solution! Our tool AwardFares is the easiest and quickest way to display available seats on Mileage Plan, and it is very intuitive to apply filters to only display partner airlines. Here's a step-by-step guide.

Notes:

* These are starting rates, so the actual number of miles you need for a redemption may be higher.
* Award seats are not always available, so it's important to book your flights in advance.
* There are a few other factors that can affect the number of miles you need for an award redemption, such as the date of travel and the fare class of the flight.
