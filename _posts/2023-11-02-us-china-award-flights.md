## Current Status: Flights Between The United States and China

As of November 2023, direct flights between the United States and China are still limited due to a complex geopolitical situation, travel bans, and trails of COVID-19. This makes it **extremely hard** for travelers connecting between both countries to find good alternatives: non-stop flights are almost non-existant, and stopovers aren't ideal because of travel times and visa-related issues.

However, there have been some recent developments that suggest that the number of flights may be increasing soon, some of them starting in early 2024 (January and February).

The US Department of Transportation (DOT) announced that, starting in November, [the number of China-US direct regular passenger flights is expected to increase](https://airlineweekly.skift.com/2023/09/u-s-airlines-expect-further-easing-of-china-flight-limits-this-winter/) from the current 48 (24 round trips) per week to 70 per week, which is a major boost for the exchange between the two countries. The Chinese government has also agreed to reciprocate, meaning that US airlines will also be able to operate 70 direct flights per week to China.

Chinese airlines which could add more flights to the US include Air China, Beijing Capital Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines, according to the latest notice.

This is a positive development, but it is still far from the pre-pandemic level of service. In 2019, there were **over 300 direct flights per week** between the US and China.

There is a growing demand for direct flights between the US and China, and it is likely that the number of flights will continue to increase.

## What Airlines Fly US-China Nonstop?

According to [FlightConnections](https://www.flightconnections.com/) and [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights), there are 20 direct routes between the United States and China, some set to start in January 2024.

### 3. Add a Route

In the **Origin** and **Destination** fields, add one or more airports to search for flights between those locations. AwardFares will search for award flights regardless of the number of stops. You can use the **Stops** filter to only search for direct/non-stop flights.

In the example below, we search for flights [between New York City and Beijing](https://awardfares.com/search?area:NYC.area:PEK.;so:a;z:united). We use the metropolitan area code **NYC** to get results from any airport in New York (JFK, EWR, LGA) at once!

### 4. Explore dates

If you have a particular date in mind, add it by tapping on the **Calendar** field.

Alternatively, you can use AwardFares **Timeline View** to explore the seat availability on different dates. The Timeline View displays how many seats are available for each day of the week/month. The bars are color-coded, so it's easy to distinguish between cabin classes (Economy, Business, First). You can also trigger new searches by tapping the refresh icon underneath each day.

In addition, you can also tap anywhere on the flight to display more details in an expanded view, such as aircraft type, and even [get the current seat maps](https://blog.awardfares.com/seatmaps-guide/) to see which seats are free versus occupied!

### 5. Sort by Price

Whether you are exploring dates using the Timeline View or have selected a specific day, AwardFares will show you the available seats (with real-time data) within seconds in the result list below.

You can tap on the different header columns to sort the results by price. Use the **Eco**, **Prem**, **Biz**, and **First** class tags to find cheap awards across multiple dates, itineraries, and airlines.

### 6. Book with the Airline

Once you have identified the flights you want (or built an itinerary using our Journey Planner), go to the airline's website and make the booking. Remember that some of these itineraries are not bookable online for specific programs (e.g., mixed-cabin awards on SAS EuroBonus). In those situations, you will need to call their service center.
