## Current Status: Flights Between The United States and China

As of November 2023, direct flights between the United States and China are still limited due to a complex geopolitical situation, travel bans, and trails of COVID-19. This makes it **extremely hard** for travelers connecting between both countries to find good alternatives: non-stop flights are almost nonexistent, and stopovers aren't ideal because of travel times and visa-related issues.

However, there have been some recent developments that suggest that the number of flights may be increasing soon, some of them starting in early 2024 (January and February).

The US Department of Transportation (DOT) announced that, starting in November, [the number of China-US direct regular passenger flights is expected to increase](https://airlineweekly.skift.com/2023/09/u-s-airlines-expect-further-easing-of-china-flight-limits-this-winter/) from the current 48 (24 round trips) per week to 70 per week, which is a major boost for the exchange between the two countries. The Chinese government has also agreed to reciprocate, meaning that US airlines will also be able to operate 70 direct flights per week to China.

Chinese airlines which could add more flights to the US include Air China, Beijing Capital Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines, according to the latest notice.

This is a positive development, but it is still far from the pre-pandemic level of service. In 2019, there were **over 300 direct flights per week** between the US and China.

There is a growing demand for direct flights between the US and China, and it is likely that the number of flights will continue to increase.

## What Airlines Fly US-China Nonstop?

According to [FlightConnections](https://www.flightconnections.com/) and [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights), there are 20 direct routes between the United States and China, some set to start in January 2024.

### Japan Airlines

JAL is renowned for its punctuality, exceptional customer service, and high-quality in-flight experience, offering comfortable seating and a wide array of entertainment options. You can expect meticulous attention to detail and a incredibly pleasant journey no matter the cabin class.

As a member of Oneworld, it provides more options when it comes to award flights and redemptions across programs. It also reaches cities or destinations that are not mainstream.

JAL operates a ton of daily flights to/from Tokyo’s Narita (NRT) or Haneda (HND) airports.

What can sometimes be complicated with Japan is navigating visa requirements or travel restrictions, especially in times of heightened security or health concerns. Japan used to have very strict COVID-19 restrictions in place, even for transfers.

<img src="../assets/img/us-china-award-flights/ana.webp" alt="Award flights from the United States to china with All Nippon Airways (AwardFares)." />

### Cathay Pacific

The airline primarily routes its US to China flights via Hong Kong, a major global aviation hub. There are options from New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), or San Francisco (SFO) to various destinations in China, connecting through Hong Kong (HKG).

While Cathay Pacific offers a streamlined connection via Hong Kong, the geopolitical tensions between Hong Kong and Mainland China could potentially affect flight schedules or operations. Travelers should be aware of any evolving circumstances and check for any related travel advisories or changes in flight patterns.

**How to book**: Alaska Mileage Plan

### Turkish Airlines

Turkish Airlines is celebrated for its expansive in-flight meal offerings, generous legroom, and top-notch service standards. Also, their A350 cabin is just amazing. 

A popular route is Seattle (SEA) to Istanbul (IST) which can then connect to Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities in Mainland China. Award availability is good across various Star Alliance programs, and can present to travelers a good alternative even for credit card point transfers.

It's clear that geographic position of Istanbul means that the total flight path is much longer than other more direct routes or connections through East Asian hubs. However, Turkish as a flexible policy for long layovers, letting you stay overnight at a hotel for free, or even staying at Istanbul for up to 72hs to explore and 

Price-wise it's also not bad, there are good options at just 54k EuroBonus points one-way in Economy.

**How to book**: SAS EuroBonus, United MileagePlus, Aeroplan

### Lufthansa and SWISS

Lufthansa and SWISS are known for their high service standards, comfortable seating, and quality in-flight amenities. Travelers can expect a consistent experience (check [our reviews here](https://blog.awardfares.com/tags/#Review)). These hubs are also well-equipped to handle international transfers, often making smooth connections.

However, a layover in Europe leads to longer total travel time compared to other flights from the US to China. Depending on the flight schedules, layovers can be exhausting or inconvenient, especially if they require overnight stays. Lastly, keep in mind that transiting through European hubs may expose travelers to additional entry or transit restrictions.

**How to book**: SAS EuroBonus, United MileagePlus, Aeroplan

<img src="../assets/img/us-china-award-flights/us-fra-pek.webp" alt="Award flights from the United States to China with Lufthansa or SWISS (AwardFares)."/>

### Ethiopian Airways

A significant benefit of flying with Ethiopian Airways is often the competitive pricing. As the airline tries to win over others, even on points, they offer a super cost-effective option for long haul travel (e.g., 90k points round trip). Additionally, Ethiopian Airlines has built a solid reputation for its hospitality and service quality. The Addis Ababa hub, which serves as the airline's main transit point, has increasingly become a strategic and efficient gateway for connecting flights between the Americas, Africa, and Asia.

On the downside, the flight path from the US to China via Ethiopia might be lengthier than direct routes or other more northerly connecting routes, leading, as expected, to longer travel times. Frequency is also less, which reduces flexibility. Additionally, the Addis Ababa airport, while modern, can sometimes face capacity constraints during peak times. Lastly, transit regulations or health screenings in Ethiopia might pose additional considerations for some travelers.

### Air France/KLM

Fly from the United States to Beijing (PEK) and Shanghai (PVG) via Amsterdam (AMS) or Paris (CDG)

### 3. Add a Route

In the **Origin** and **Destination** fields, add one or more airports to search for flights between those locations. AwardFares will search for award flights regardless of the number of stops. You can use the **Stops** filter to only search for direct/non-stop flights.

In the example below, we search for flights [between New York City and Beijing](https://awardfares.com/search?area:NYC.area:PEK.;so:a;z:united). We use the metropolitan area code **NYC** to get results from any airport in New York (JFK, EWR, LGA) at once!

If you have a particular date in mind, add it by tapping on the **Calendar** field.

Alternatively, you can use AwardFares **Timeline View** to explore the seat availability on different dates. The Timeline View displays how many seats are available for each day of the week/month. The bars are color-coded, so it's easy to distinguish between cabin classes (Economy, Business, First). You can also trigger new searches by tapping the refresh icon underneath each day.

In addition, you can also tap anywhere on the flight to display more details in an expanded view, such as aircraft type, and even [get the current seat maps](https://blog.awardfares.com/seatmaps-guide/) to see which seats are free versus occupied!

### 5. Sort by Price

Whether you are exploring dates using the Timeline View or have selected a specific day, AwardFares will show you the available seats (with real-time data) within seconds in the result list below.

You can tap on the different header columns to sort the results by price. Use the **Eco**, **Prem**, **Biz**, and **First** class tags to find cheap awards across multiple dates, itineraries, and airlines.

### 6. Book with the Airline

Once you have identified the flights you want (or built an itinerary using our Journey Planner), go to the airline's website and make the booking. Remember that some of these itineraries are not bookable online for specific programs (e.g., mixed-cabin awards on SAS EuroBonus). In those situations, you will need to call their service center.
