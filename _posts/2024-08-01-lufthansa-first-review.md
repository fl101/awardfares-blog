While Lufthansa recently started the rollout of their [Allegris product](/lufthansa-allegris-first-flight) it's far from done and in fact the first class cabin hasn't been updated yet. That being said the current Lufthansa First Class is still a great product and I was lucky enough to fly it from Munich to Boston.

## How I Booked This Flight

With SAS being my primary frequent flyer program and their upcoming exit from Star Alliance I wanted to take one last opportunity to enjoy the Lufthansa First Class experience. While it's always been tricky to find First Class seats, AwardFares will automatically search [all LH First routes](https://awardfares.com/search?..;c:first;a:LH;z:sas) so that you can easily get an overview of what's available. This availability is estimated based on other programs though so in the end it's the call to the booking agent that will determine if you can get the seat or not. In my case I was lucky and the two seats I saw were indeed available. With some help from the agent we also managed to find fitting connections in both Frankfurt and Munich to maximize the experience.

## Seat & Cabin

While the seats are certainly showing their age a little, they're still massive and extremely comfortable. The A380 cabin is also much more spacious than both the 747 and A340 which I've tried before. The first class cabin is located on the upper deck and consists of 8 seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. The seats are very private and offer a lot of storage space, including a personal wardrobe. The seat can be adjusted in many ways and of course folds down fully for sleeping, the staff will also help you make the bed with a mattress pad and duvet. With the cabin being in the top front the noise from the engines is minimal, we were able to have a conversation without raising our voices even during take off.

A quirk of the front of the A380 is the two areas on either side of the front stair case. Different airlines have used these spaces in different ways, Lufthansa has chosen to make two giant but long bathrooms. They both feature a long bench to sit on which looks very elegant but in my opinion serves no practical purpose. Other airlines have used the space for a lounge area with the bathrooms being slightly smaller which I think would be a better use of the space. A fun quirk is that Lufthansa offers a payphone next to the bathrooms, although with calls being charged $9.95/min you'd certainly have to be desperate to use it.

## Food & Drink Service

Food and Drinks are always excellent with Lufthansa First Class and this time was no different. Sadly since the flight is one of the shortest ones with First Class there was relatively little time to enjoy the food, but the quality was certainly excellent.

The service starts with a pre-departure drink (Unlike in business class they're happy to open any drink they have on board, not just the champagne) and some macadamia nuts. Once in the air the meal is a full five course dinner consisting of amuse bouche, caviar, starters, main course and of course dessert. The selection of main courses usually includes a meat, fish and vegetarian option which in my experience have all been excellent. The wine list is extensive and the crew is always happy to help you find the perfect pairing.

On this particular flight the second serving was a light dinner instead of a breakfast, since the arrival time is around 8pm in Boston. As there was only 4 passengers in the cabin (Which seats 8) there was some leftover caviar from the first service which the crew was happy to serve us as a second course.

## Lounge

If you have a First Class ticket on a flight departing the same day you're eligible to access the Lufthansa First Class Terminal as well as any of their First Class Lounges, even if your flight departs from another airport. We had an overnight layover, starting the day in Frankfurt, following up with a short stay in Munich and finally the First Class flight in the afternoon.

</figure>

This gave us the opportunity to visit both the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the First Class Lounge in Munich. The First Class Terminal is a unique experience in itself, a lounge attendant will greet you upon arrival and take care of everything from checking in the luggage (In our case that was already done in Stockholm) and escort you through a private security check. Once inside the terminal offers a la carte dining, a cigar lounge, and a quiet room with daybeds, bath tubs and of course a well-stocked bar with a generous selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

On the morning of our flight some climate activists had caused a shutdown of the airport for a few hours and it was clearly noticeable in the terminal as the staff was working hard to solve the issues arising from delayed and canceled flights. The lounge was also significantly more crowded than usual as passengers were waiting for their flights to be rescheduled.

Both breakfast and lunch were great, with both a la carte and buffet options available. The service is fast, we sat down for lunch about 30 minutes before boarding and were able to comfortably finish our meal without any rush. The menu on offer rotates with current events, for example there were a few France themed dishes to celebrate the Olympics, but there are always a few staple meals available such as Schnitzel and burgers.

Finally when it's time to leave the lounge attendant will escort you downstairs where a car is waiting for you. Previously I've always been able to get a private car, however with how busy the lounge was this time we had to share with two other passengers who were on the same flight to Munich.

In Munich the First Class Lounge is a bit more traditional, with a buffet and a la carte dining available. There are two lounges available, one in the main terminal and one in the satellite terminal. The satellite terminal lounge offers a better view of the tarmac as well as an outdoor terrace. The lounge is located in both the Schengen and non-Schengen area so you're able to do the passport control in the lounge and avoid the queues in the terminal.

## Amenity Kit

The amenity kit is sadly one of the only bad parts of the Lufthansa First Class experience. In the past the kit has been a Rimowa as well as a very elegant Sinn leather box but now it's a very basic bag with a few L'Occitane products. The bag seems to be made of very cheap material and the products inside are nothing special. The only thing that stands out is the socks which are very comfortable. The pajamas is great as usual though and the slippers have a very thick and cushy sole making them extremely comfortable.

## IFE & Wi-Fi

The IFE is one of the few disappointments in Lufthansa's First Class cabin. It's clearly showing its age through the relatively small screen, which i exacerbated by the fact that the screen is quite far away from the seat, since the seat pitch is so large. The screen is also extremely slow and in today's world of snappy smartphones it certainly feels dated. The selection is not bad though with plenty of new and old movies to pick from. Sadly my favorite thing about the A380, the tail camera, wasn't working on this flight.

Lufthansa does offer free Wi-Fi services to First Class though which worked great throughout the flight.

## Sleep

Sleep in First Class is always excellent, in this case a bit short due to the short flight time, but the bed is very comfortable and the crew will help you make it with a mattress pad and duvet. The cabin is also very quiet and the seat is very private so you're able to sleep without any disturbances. The seat itself is very soft and combined with the mattress pad it's as comfortable as any hotel bed. Ear plugs and sleeping masks are of course provided in the amenity kit should you need them. The crew will also ask you when you want to be woken up, in this case they suggested 1 hour and 45 minutes before landing but as we wanted some extra sleep we asked for 1 hour before landing which still gave us enough time for a quick meal and changing back to regular clothes.

## Conclusion

Lufthansa First Class is an all around amazing product. I often try to explain to people that the difference between business and first class is almost as big as the difference between economy and business class. While one might argue that "it's just a bigger seat and better food" I think that misses an important part of First Class which is the luxury touch. From the separate terminal, to the attendant fetching you when it's time to board, the limo to the flight, the whole experience is designed so that you as a passenger shouldn't have to think about the fact that you're flying. The flying is just a thing that happens around you while you're enjoying a great meal, a good selection of drinks and a comfortable bed.

While aren't the best in any individual category, they offer by far the best package experience out of all the First Class airlines I've tried. I will certainly miss flying with them when SAS leaves Star Alliance.
