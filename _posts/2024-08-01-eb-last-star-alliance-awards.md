## 1. Lufthansa First Class

Lufthansa First Class is a fantastic product all around. From the separate terminal to the attendant fetching you when it's time to board, the limo to the flight, the whole experience is designed so that you, as a passenger, shouldn't have to think about the fact that you're flying. Flying is just a thing that happens around you while enjoying a great meal, a good selection of drinks, and a comfortable bed. We recently had a chance to [say goodbye to Lufthansa First Class on this A380 flight from Munich to Boston](https://blog.awardfares.com/lufthansa-first-muc-bos/).

## 10. Avianca Business Class (787)

Avianca these days is offering a more *Low-Cost Business Class* service, similar to the one you get on [ZIPAIR (check our review here)](https://blog.awardfares.com/zipair-full-flat-nrt-sfo/). We wouldn't recommend it over other alternatives, and definitely isn't our go-to choice, but for certain routes, Avianca can offer great availability when there aren't other options. Bogota can be a cool hub also. Overall, it is a solid option within South America with great connections to the caribbean and the US.
