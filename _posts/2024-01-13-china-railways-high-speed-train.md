This review is a bit of an unusual one as we usually review airlines, but since China Rail offers a Business Class product on their high speed trains, which are also intended to compete with domestic air travel, we figured it would fit.

The train from Shanghai to Shenzhen takes about 8 hours, if you factor in that the station is in a very central location as well as the fact that you only need to be at the train station around 30 minutes before departure (The security check is a breeze compared to an airport) this offers a competitive travel time compared to flying. While the flight is around 3 hours, all the extra buffer time needed as well as travel time to and from the airport and the high frequency of delays and cancellations on Chinese domestic flights makes the train a very attractive option. The train station in Shanghai is also right next to Shanghai Hongqiao airport which means you can easily connect to an international flight if needed.

The train offers Second, First, and Business Class ordered from least to most premium (As opposed to airlines where First Class is usually the most luxurious one). Second and First class both have 2-2 seating with the only real difference being the seat pitch which is slightly bigger in First Class as well as a snack box being offered. Business Class on the other hand offers a fully reclining seat, similar to what you'd find on an airplane as well as a 1-2 configuration for more space and a full meal.

The price is also quite competitive, with fixed prices for all journeys based on the duration. For a long trip like this one the price for Business Class was about 2600 RMB (Around 350 USD), First Class around 1300¥ and Second Class around 800¥. When offered the possibility to "fly" business class for a similar price as economy class on a flight, I could not turn it down. So was it worth the price or is this a product that looks good on paper but doesn't live up to the promise?

## Lounge

Another part of the Business Class offering is access to the lounge as well as a fast track "VIP Lane" when checking the ticket. However since I'm not a Chinese citizen I don't have a Chinese ID card which means I have to use the manual check-in counter regardless of class and it just happens to be the same as the VIP lane, so as a foreigner you basically always get fast track regardless of class.

In Shanghai Hongqiao station the lounge is located immediately after security, as in the security check _is_ the entrance to the lounge. The lounge however was quite small considering the size of the station and the number of trains departing from it so it was very crowded. It offers a small selection of soft drinks and snacks, nothing amazing, as well as a service desk. Interestingly when we entered they gave us a number and told us they would come and pick us up in time for departure (Reminding me of Lufthansa's First Class Terminal) however they didn't follow through on this promise and we made our own way to the platform.

The lounge is certainly starting to show its age with chairs being quite worn and the overall design being quite dated. If you've ever been to an Air China lounge at a Chinese airport you'll know what I mean. That being said it still offers a nice place to sit down and relax before the train departs, slightly calmer than the main station.

## Seat & Cabin

The seat is a fully relining lie-flat seat, very similar at first glance to what you'd find on a plane. The seats also rotate (this is true for all cabins) so that they always face in the direction of travel even when the train turns around at certain cul-de-sac stations. In Business Class you're however free to choose the direction you want to face, provided that you've booked two or more seats on adjacent rows. For example if you're a group of 4 with seats 01AB and 02AB you can arrange them facing each other in a QSuite style arrangement.

However that's about where the similarities with QSuite or any other premium airline cabin ends. While the seats might look very puffy and comfortable on a photo they are actually as hard as a church bench. There is simply no way to sleep comfortably on them. If you've ever experienced a deflated chair in SAS Business Class (The air mattress type seat) you know what to compare it to. All in all the seats look great on paper (Or in a photo) but are terrible in reality. I'd even argue that the First and Second class seats are much more comfortable, although the layout is a more traditional train layout as you can see in the photo above.

## Food & Drink Service

On longer trips a snack box is offered in both First Class and Business Class. It contains a large variety of savory snacks which are actually quite good. They range from things like crackers to beef jerky and crab roe flavored sunflower seeds (Surprisingly good!).

As for drinks the only things on offer are non-alcoholic, some juice, water, of course tea as well as coffee. In addition there is a person with a cart walking the train selling milk tea, snacks, and sodas. These are however charged, even in business class. They also sell the same meals packets which are included in business class.

Finally there is a meal offering on longer trips such as this one, a pre-packaged hot meal served in a box that would look more at home on an economy class flight. They offered two options, beef and shrimp. I opted for the beef version which was passable, certainly not bad but nothing impressive. Even less impressive is the fact that you can buy this meal for about 40 RMB in any cabin from the snacks and drinks cart.

Not only that, but using the QR code on your seat you can pre-order meals from restaurants along the way which they then bring on to the train and to your seat! This does come with the caveat that it (Like a lot of things in China) requires the WeChat app as well as some basic Chinese language skills to understand the menu. If you're a foreigner both of these might provide a challenge, but if you're able to overcome them the selection is amazing, ranging from local mom-and-pop food stalls to big chains like McDonald's and Dairy Queen. The selection will vary by station and orders close 1 hour before the train arrives at a station so make sure to order in time.

## Summary

While the prospect of a luxurious train ride for 3000¥ certainly sounded promising, sadly my experience on the Business Class bullet train was similar to a lot of other Chinese "luxury" products: They look great on the surface but dig just a little deeper and it falls apart. Since the price difference from First Class (The best value in my opinion) is 1300 RMB and the only improvements are the seat, the lounge and the free food, you have to ask yourself are those 3 worth the 1300 RMB? In my opinion that's a resounding "No", the food costs 40¥ if you really want it (Though there are plenty of better options), the seat was terrible, and the lounge wasn't really that great.

1300¥ goes a long way in China and you're much better off spending this money on something else, like a luxury meal, and have a more comfortable experience in First or Second class. The train service as a whole is a great service though, offering fast and smooth service with very few delays compared to domestic flights.
