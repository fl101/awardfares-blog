Flying with American Airlines? Starting February 20, 2024, the airline is implementing several changes that will impact how you pack, earn miles, and book your next trip. These changes aim to reward loyalty and incentivize booking directly with American Airlines. AAdvantage members will enjoy additional benefits, while some fees will increase for non-direct bookings.

Let's have a quick look at the updates!

## American Airlines Changes (February 2024)

### Changes to Earning Miles and Loyalty Points

- Starting May 1st, only bookings made directly with American, through participating partners, or with specific travel agencies will earn miles and Loyalty Points.
- Basic Economy fare tickets will only earn miles when booked directly with American.
- AAdvantage members can still earn miles and points through partner programs like hotels, shopping portals, and events.

### Checked Bag Fees

- **More expensive**: Expect to pay $35 for your first checked bag online, or $40 at the airport (previously $30). A second checked bag costs $45 online or at the airport (previously $40).
- **Good news for some**: AAdvantage members and credit cardholders with specific cards will continue to enjoy complimentary checked bags.
- **Overweight and oversized bag fees** will be restructured with lower costs for slightly exceeding standard dimensions.
- **Goodbye bulky items**: Starting April 17th, javelins, pole vaults, and hang gliders are no longer allowed as checked baggage.
- **Pet-in-cabin** fees will increase to $150.
