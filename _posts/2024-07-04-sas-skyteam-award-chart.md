## Earning Points on Air France and KLM

Starting in September 2024, EuroBonus members will earn Bonus points and Level points on qualifying flights as shown in the formula and table below. The number of points depends on the travel class, booking class and distance flown.

Depending on the membership level, you can earn 25% (Silver), 50% (Gold) or 75% (Diamond) more Bonus points on flights.

On own-marketed flights, a minimum distance of 500 miles is applied. For example: for a flight with a distance of 375 miles, a distance in miles of 500 will be applied to the formula below instead of 375.

**Bonus points earned = Distance in miles x [distance multiplier + booking class multiplier + (distance multiplier x bonus point booster) ]**

**Level points earned = Distance in miles x [distance multiplier + booking class multiplier]**
