It's been a while, but we're happy to announce that searching Star Alliance award availability for SAS EuroBonus is finally back. This should hopefully make it much easier to find availability, especially since throughout the past year, we have noticed an increasing amount of discrepancy in Star Alliance award availability offered across different frequent flyer programs (SAS EuroBonus, United MileagePlus, Avianca LifeMiles, and Air Canada Aeroplan).

There are still two major limitations though. Booking Singapore Airlines is still not available (apparently due to technical issues). The same applies when trying to book awards by telephone. Also, First Class availability for EuroBonus is still not visible online, so for that you still need to estimate the availability using other frequent flyer programs.

This also means that once again it is possible to [book](https://www.sas.se/eurobonus/star-alliance-award-trips/) EuroBonus Star Alliance awards online, even if you want to use a 2-4-1 voucher. Great news for all of us that still have vouchers to use before the end of the calendar year!

## New Feature: Filter By Program

We also recently released a highly requested feature. It is now possible to filter and search by a specific Frequent Flyer Program. On the search page you can choose the programs you'd like to search in the top-left corner, making results faster and more accurate!

The same can be done when creating alerts:
