## Why Etihad Guest?

[**Etihad Guest**](https://www.etihadguest.com/), the frequent flyer program of Etihad Airways, stands out for its flexible earning and redemption options, plus a great overall availability. With generous stopover programs in Abu Dhabi, frequent special promotions, and a strong focus on customer service, Etihad Guest provides a premium and rewarding experience for frequent travelers, particularly those traveling to or through the Middle East.

Etihad's extensive partner network also enables earning and redeeming miles on numerous airlines globally. Some key innovative features of the program are **Milesbooster**, **Cash+Miles**, and **Family Membership** (pooling) for quicker mile accumulation and easier redemptions.

## Top Things You Need To Know About Etihad Guest in 2024

- **Major Revamp in June 2024**: The program underwent a significant relaunch in 2024, introducing new ways to earn and redeem miles.
- **Earning Miles**: Tier Segments are gone! You now earn Etihad Guest Tier Miles only. Miles can be earned through flying Etihad or partner airlines, as well as non-flying activities like credit card spending (depending on the card). To qualify for elite status, you need to meet a minimum threshold of flying miles alongside total Tier Miles.
- **Redeeming Miles**: Award redemptions on some popular routes for economy and business class have seen a decrease. You can choose from different perk packages at each elite tier (Core, Custom, and Beyond). More custom perks come with higher tiers.
- **Other Changes**: Miles can no longer be extended through inactivity. Flights are the only way to extend them now. Award cancellation now incurs fees ranging from 25% to 75% of redeemed miles.

## What AwardFares Offers to Etihad Guest Members

- **Real-time Etihad Award Seat Availability**: Find the latest award seat availability for Etihad Airways flights directly through AwardFares.
- **Flexible Date Search**: Search for specific travel dates or use AwardFares' Timeline View to explore award options across a wider date range.
- **Compare Programs, Find the Best Deal**: Compare Etihad Guest award options with other loyalty programs (like other Etihad Guest partners or programs like Qatar Airways Privilege Club) to ensure you're getting the best value for your miles. This is particularly helpful when you have point transfer partners such as credit card loyalty programs with transferrable points.
- **Maximize Etihad Guest Miles**: AwardFares helps you find the most cost-effective ways to redeem your Etihad Guest Miles, allowing you to stretch your points further.

## Understanding Etihad Guest Award Chart

In the past, Etihad Guest offered a traditional award chart outlining the exact number of miles needed for flights based on distance and cabin class. However, as of 2024, Etihad Guest switched to a dynamic award system. This means there's no longer a published chart, and the miles required for a specific flight can vary depending on factors like demand, seasonality, and availability.

While this might seem less transparent, Etihad Guest offers a Miles Calculator on their [website](https://www.etihadguest.com/en/spend-miles/flying.html). This tool allows you to easily search for the miles needed on your desired route and travel dates.

Here's what to keep in mind:

- GuestSeat Awards: These are fixed-mileage redemptions for Etihad Airways flights, offering the best value when available.
- Miles & Cash: This option allows you to combine miles with a cash payment for more flexibility in booking flights.
