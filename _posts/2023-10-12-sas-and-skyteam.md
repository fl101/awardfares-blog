With all the buzz around SAS joining SkyTeam [after being acquired by Air France-KLM](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-acquisition/) and others, we read many negative comments about this transition. At AwardFares, we are focused on helping EuroBonus members navigate this new phase by bringing the latest tools and information we have at hand.

We also strive for a positive, more resilient mindset during unsettling times like this one. Sure, there are aspects we will miss from Star Alliance, but we are taking our first step towards embracing change. In this post, we look at the bright side and cover some opportunities that will come once SAS is a member of SkyTeam.

## SAS in SkyTeam: The Bright Side {#sas-in-skyteam}

### 1. Heavy investment from Air France-KLM

As Air France-KLM is getting a stake in SAS, their investment has the potential to provide several benefits to the Scandinavian airline, including increased financial stability, expanded network and connectivity, shared expertise and resources, and increased competitiveness. On top of that, Air France-KLM is known for its high-quality customer service and excellent staff training.

### 2. North America Still Strong With Delta Air Lines And Aeroméxico

SkyTeam's founding members, Delta Air Lines and Aeroméxico are both major airlines in these regions that boasts an extensive global network, connecting travelers to over 300 destinations across 50 countries. Delta's modern fleet, featuring state-of-the-art aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, ensures a comfortable and enjoyable flying experience.

With SkyPriority, frequent flyers get complimentary upgrades, priority boarding, and access to exclusive lounges. Recognized for its excellent customer service, Delta consistently ranks among the top airlines in customer satisfaction surveys.

### 3. An Open Door To Brazil

GOL Airlines is not a SkyTeam partner but a valuable partner for SkyTeam travelers seeking to explore South America's largest country. Both Air France-KLM and Delta have a significant stake in the company. With its extensive domestic network spanning over 60 destinations, GOL provides convenient connections to Brazil's iconic landmarks, from the bustling metropolis of São Paulo to the sun-kissed beaches of Rio de Janeiro and the lush rainforests of the Amazon.

SkyTeam passengers can seamlessly integrate GOL flights into their itineraries, enjoying seamless connections and reciprocal benefits through the SkyTeam partnership (earning and redeeming miles on GOL flights too). GOL's modern fleet and commitment to on-time performance ensure a comfortable and reliable travel experience. Explore Brazil's diverse regions, from the vibrant cultural hub of Salvador to the breathtaking Iguazu Falls, all made accessible through GOL's extensive domestic connections.

### 4. Discover Argentina

Aerolíneas Argentinas, the flag carrier of Argentina, is a key partner for SkyTeam members seeking to discover the wonders of this South American gem. With its extensive domestic network and seamless connections to SkyTeam's global network, Aerolíneas Argentinas opens up a world of possibilities for travelers to explore Argentina's diverse landscapes, vibrant cities, and rich cultural heritage.

From the bustling urban center of Buenos Aires to the stunning landscapes of Patagonia, the Iguazu Falls in the northeast, or the wine regions of Mendoza, the airline ensures that the beauty and diversity of Argentina are accessible to everyone. 

The airline also assures SkyTeam travelers of quality service, consistent with the standards they expect from the alliance. By flying with Aerolíneas Argentinas, SkyTeam travelers not only unlock the wonders of Argentina but also experience the warm hospitality and rich culture that the nation is renowned for.

### 5. A Gateway To China

SkyTeam has not one, but **two** Chinese member airlines. This duo makes it a perfect choice if you are flying long-haul but also connecting domestically within Mainland China. 

The two airlines are:

- **China Eastern Airlines** is one of the three major airlines in Mainland China and is headquartered in Shanghai. It has a fleet of over 750 aircraft and flies to over 250 destinations worldwide.
- **Xiamen Airlines** is a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines and is headquartered in Xiamen, Fujian Province. It has a fleet of over 200 aircraft and flies to over 60 destinations worldwide. In 2019, [China Southern left SkyTeam](https://simpleflying.com/china-southern-skyteam/), but interestingly Xiamen Airlines still remains a member.

In addition, there's **China Southern**. While this airline also left SkyTeam recently, there are still many valid codeshare agreements with SkyTeam airlines, which might make it possible to redeem award flights on them (just like with GOL).

Together, these airlines provide travelers with a wide range of options for reaching their desired destinations, both within China and around the globe.

### 6. China Airlines: Taiwan's National Carrier

China Airlines is the largest airline in Taiwan and is headquartered in Taoyuan International Airport and also serves Songshan Airport located in central Taipei. It has a fleet of over 90 aircraft and flies to over 150 destinations worldwide, connecting Asia to Europe, North America and the Pacific.

### 7. Virgin Atlantic: A Hidden British Gem

Virgin Atlantic is a unique and prominent British airline known for its innovative approach and customer-centric service. It joined SkyTeam in March 2023, being SkyTeam's first and only UK member airline.

Operating primarily out of London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as Manchester Airport, Virgin Atlantic offers a diverse range of routes to destinations around the world, with a strong presence in North America and the Caribbean. The airline is known for its stylish and comfortable cabins, friendly service, and commitment to sustainability, making it a popular choice for both leisure and business travelers seeking a distinctive and enjoyable flying experience.

Virgin Atlantic is on a mission to be carbon neutral by 2050, and has recently introduced new Business Class cabins on their A330neo aircraft.

### 6. ITA Airways A350

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: *ITA Airways, is set to leave SkyTeam and join Star Alliance in the near future. While there's still no ETA and it's not clear if it is going to happen before or after SAS joins SkyTeam, take this example as a 'grab while they last' case.*

ITA Airways' A350 business class provides a comfortable and stylish experience for discerning travelers, offering a blend of modern amenities, Italian hospitality, and culinary delights. Their A350 business class cabin features Collins Aerospace Super Diamond reverse herringbone seats arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration.
