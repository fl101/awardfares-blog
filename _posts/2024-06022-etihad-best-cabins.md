## The New Etihad Guest Award Types: GuestSeats vs OpenSeats

As an Etihad Guest member, you can use your miles to buy *GuestSeats* and *OpenSeats*. And since early 2024, for the first time, you can now use your miles to experience ultimate luxury in The Residence.

### GuestSeats: The Value Champion

GuestSeats are a hidden gem for Etihad Guest members. These exclusive seats offer the best value for your miles, with fixed, reduced fares across all Etihad flights (up to 30% off). Availability is limited, so be quick!

[AwardFares Alerts](https://blog.awardfares.com/alerts/) can be of great advantage for finding GuestSeats. Simply search for a route, and use the *Max Price* filter to get notified when a seat is available at a lower price!

Here's a taste of what you can expect:

* **Economy GuestSeat**: Perfect for budget-conscious travelers. Expect routes like Abu Dhabi (AUH) to Bangkok (BKK) starting around 20,000 miles (round trip).
* **Business GuestSeat**: Take your comfort to the next level with lie-flat seats. Popular routes like AUH to London (LHR) can start around 45,000 miles (round trip).

### OpenSeats: Flexibility with a Price

OpenSeats offer more flexibility for booking flights with your miles, but the cost reflects market prices. Here's a general range:

* **Economy OpenSeat**: Prices can vary depending on the route and season. Expect a range of 25,000 to 70,000 miles (round trip) for routes like AUH to Frankfurt (FRA).
* **Business OpenSeat**: Enjoy lie-flat comfort with fares ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 miles (round trip) on routes like AUH to New York (JFK).
