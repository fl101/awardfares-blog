## The Basics Of Amex 2-for-1 Vouchers

The American Express (Amex) 2-for-1 vouchers are a unique type of companion vouchers for SAS Amex cardholders in Sweden and Norway.

A companion voucher is a benefit offered by some credit cards that allows you to book a second seat on a flight for a companion for no additional cost or at a significantly reduced cost.

Historically, the Amex 2-for-1 vouchers have been very lucrative for SAS EuroBonus members,

### What Amex cards offer the voucher?

In both Sweden and Norway, these vouchers are offered to all SAS Amex Elite and SAS Amex Premium cardholders, after meeting the qualification requirements.

### How the voucher works

The voucher allows the cardholder to book two tickets for the price of one, using only points for the second ticket. This is applicable on flights operated by SAS.

Reservations can generally be made online, through SAS website or the special Star Alliance award search landing page. It's also possible to book via the SAS call center.

### How to qualify for a voucher?

Overall, the conditions are straightforward. As a cardholder, each time you spend 150.000 SEK/NOK in a year, you get a voucher. For the SAS Amex Premium card, you can get a maximum of **one** voucher a year, while up to **two** vouchers if you are a SAS Amex Elite holder.

Note that, it is also possible to apply for both the SAS Amex Premium and SAS Amex Elite **at the same time**. This is not against Amex Terms and Conditions, as long as you pay for the maintenance fees. Then, you can get up to three vouchers in total, if you meet the qualification requirements on each card (450.000 SEK/NOK).

| Country | Card | Qualification Requirements |
|---------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Sweden  | SAS Amex Premium                       | Get one voucher after spending 150.000 SEK during a calendar year. |
| Sweden  | SAS Amex Elite                         | Get one voucher after spending 150.000 SEK, and another voucher after spending 300.000 SEK during a calendar year.  |
| Norway  | SAS Amex Premium                       | Get one voucher after spending 150.000 NOK during a calendar year. |
| Norway  | SAS Amex Elite                         | Get one voucher after spending 150.000 NOK, and another voucher after spending 300.000 SEK during a calendar year. |

### Validity

The American Express 2-for 1 voucher is valid from the date you receive your voucher until the end of the following calendar year. For example, if you reach your voucher already on 31 July 2021, you can book from that date until 31 December 2022. Please note that even if the booking must be made before the expiration date, the trip itself can be completed after the expiration date.

### How to use the 2-for-1 voucher

For SAS flights, you can book your American Express 2-for-1 voucher online or by phone.

No ticket or booking fee is charged for online bookings. A booking fee of 375 SEK/NOK per person is charged for telephone booking (except when booking is not possible online).

A ticket fee of 450 SEK/NOK per person will be charged on all Star Alliance bookings. An additional booking fee of 375 SEK/NOK per person will be charged for bookings made by telephone (except when booking is not possible online).

### Limitations and Considerations

* Excluded Fees: Additional fees, such as taxes and surcharges, are typically not covered by the voucher and must be paid separately.
* Cancellation/Change Policies: The voucher's cancellation or change policies should be understood, as they may differ from standard ticket policies.
