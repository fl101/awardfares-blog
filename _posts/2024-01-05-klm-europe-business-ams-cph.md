I was looking to book a flight from Amsterdam (AMS) to Copenhagen (CPH) and remembered I still had some miles in my Delta SkyMiles account. Luckily, it was just enough for a one-way Economy redemption on KLM, which I found thanks to the [new Delta SkyMiles integration](/introducing-delta/) in AwardFares.

During check-in through the KLM app, I saw that there was an option to upgrade to Business class. I decided to try it since I hadn't tried KLM Business within Europe before.

## A Slow Start Out of Schiphol

Flying out of Amsterdam is very hit or miss. On this occasion, several things could have gone better. Since I had upgraded to Business (and thanks to my SkyTeam Elite Plus status), I could use Sky Priority to check in my luggage. However, there were better choices than this. It wasn't particularly crowded, but the check-in staff strictly checked everyone's luggage weight, which meant getting stuck behind a queue of people re-arranging their luggage. It would have been way faster to use the regular check-in.

At least security control was efficient, and I eventually made my way to the KLM Crown Lounge 25 (Schengen). This lounge is usually very crowded and hectic (and the food selection is usually very disappointing).

Unfortunately, my flight was delayed almost 2 hours due to a mechanical issue with the plane. At least the lounge quieted down a lot later in the evening.

I was eventually kicked out of the lounge since it closed at 22:00, and I made my way down to the gate, where I waited a bit more until I could finally board.

## A Fairly Standard Intra-Europe Business, With Friendly Crew

As with most intra-Europe business classes, KLM offers 3-3 seating with blocked middle seats, ensuring you have some extra space. Besides that, there was nothing special about this 737-900 cabin.

The crew was amiable and welcoming. Once airborne, the cabin crew welcomed me using my surname, which was a pleasant surprise. This may be due to my SkyTeam Elite Plus status.

For this short evening flight, they served pasta salad with smoked salmon. With my meal, I ordered a Gin and Tonic, which was served in a proper glass, and a cup of tea in a lovely Dutch delftware-style cup. I enjoy these tiny details!

## Summary

I definitely wouldn't go out of my way paying for a KLM intra-Europe business class flight, but it was fun to try. In terms of service and food, it was quite similar to [Lufthansa](lufthansa-business-class-to-lisbon/), although at least Lufthansa serves their food on a tray rather than in a box. It isn't easy to compete with [Austrian](/austrian-short-haul-business/), which probably has the best food and service in Europe business class among all the European airlines I've tried.

The Business Class experience on the Boeing 737-900ER was standard for intra-Europe flights, with a 3-3 seating arrangement and blocked middle seats. The crew was exceptionally friendly, and the small details, like the Dutch delftware-style cup for my tea, were delightful. The meal, a pasta salad with smoked salmon, was decent, and the Gin and Tonic was served in a proper glass. Comparing it to other airlines, KLM's service and food were on par with Lufthansa but not as impressive as Austrian Airlines'. Overall, while enjoyable, I wouldn't specifically pay for KLM's intra-Europe Business Class again, but it was a nice experience to try.",
