On Feburary 18 EVA Air launches their new European route to Milan (MXP):

```
BR71: TAPEI (TPE) 23:40 – 06:30(+1) MILANO (MXP)
BR72: MILANO (MXP) 11:00 – 06:30(+1) TAIPEI (TPE)
```

The route is served 4 times per week on the following days:

```
FROM TAPEI: MONDAY, TUESDAY, THURSDAY, SATURDAY
FROM MILANO: TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY
```

Revenue tickets are still not available for sale, however the award space is wide open. There are at least 2 business class awards available every day.

EVA Air is one of the best business products that I've ever flown (and even compared to first class) so this is a perfect opportunity to try it out!
