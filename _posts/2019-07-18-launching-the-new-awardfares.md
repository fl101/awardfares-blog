During the last few months we've been working very hard on a completely new version of AwardFares with many new features and improvements. Today we're launching the new version to everyone together with a new Diamond tier.

## New Diamond tier
Many have asked for more custom searches and alerts. Today we're also launching a new Diamond tier, which offers unlimited custom searches and unlimited alerts. During the first week (until July 25, 2019) we're offering a **25% discount** on all new Diamond plans (monthly and yearly).

*Note: Upgrades from Gold to Diamond are prorated, so any remaining time on an active Gold subscription will be deducted off a new Diamond subscription.*

## Redesigned search page
The main search page has been completely redesigned, with a new timeline, map, journey builder, and flights list. Our top priority was to make the UI easier to use, especially for custom searches (see below).

## Easier custom searches
Simply enter an origin, destination, and a departure date. The page will automatically start loading results for you. You can still click the search icon in the timeline to search multiple dates at once. Custom searches require a Gold or Diamond subscription, while free accounts only have access to the award calendar.

## Per-program award availability
Expanding a flight now automatically searches and displays availability per frequent flyer program. Currently this supports United MileagePlus, Air Canada Aeroplan, SAS EuroBonus, and Avianca LifeMiles. More providers coming soon! Per-program availability requires a Gold or Diamond subscription, while free accounts can only see the summarized availability data.

## Search up to 6 airports at once
Furthermore, you can now enter up to 6 airports at once for custom searches. For example, 3 origin airports + 3 destination airports, or 1 origin + 5 destinations, etc...

## New continent location filters
Besides the existing Award Zone filters you can now also search by continent. This is especially useful when searching all of Asia at once.

## Track searches
When searching a specific route and date you can now easily create an alert using the "Track" search feature. Tracking and alerts require a Gold or Diamond subscription.

## New logo and branding
As you may also have noticed, we now have a brand new logo and icon. We hope you like it as much as we do! All of the new can be found on our [Press](https://awardfares.com/press) page.

## New routes added
As always, we're continuously adding new routes to the award calendar. Recent additions include two new [Lufthansa First routes](https://blog.awardfares.com/lufthansa-first-routes-july-2019/), [EVA Air](https://blog.awardfares.com/eva-mxp-award-availability/), Air Canada, and Air New Zealand:
- Air Canada (AC): YYZ-CPH/LHR/FRA
- Air New Zealand (NZ): AKL-HNL/YVR/SFO/LAX/ORD/SIN/NRT/HND/PVG/TPE/HKG
- Lufthansa (LH): FRA-DTW, MUC-YVR
- EVA Air (BR): TPE-VIE/AMS/CDG/LHR/MXP

## Other changes
- Previously free users could see the exact number of award seats availability on a flight. From now on this is only available to Gold and Diamond users, and free users will only see whether or not any awards are available in each cabin.
- Availability can now only be refreshed once every hour for Gold users. Real-time updates will from now on require a Diamond subscription.
