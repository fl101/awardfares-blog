More breaking news (under development) on the SAS front. It all looks like it's no longer possible to book flights on Thai Airways with EuroBonus points. After [United being disabled last March](https://blog.awardfares.com/united-stops-working-with-eurobonus/), now the EuroBonus portal fails to book redemptions with Thai.

Several of our users have reported the same issue, and it has even been confirmed via SAS on the support line. This issue must be very recent, given that our cached data shows the most recent seats on Thai from yesterday.

Is this the beginning of the end of Star Alliance partners in EuroBonus?

## Thai Disappears from EuroBonus Bookings (What We Know)

As of this morning, Thai flights are no longer showing up on the SAS EuroBonus portal. We still see a ton of fresh results in our cached data, from yesterday.

Here's an example of a flight from Copenhagen (CPH) to Bangkok (BKK). However, when we refresh the search, it disappears.

This flight also doesn't show up on the Star Alliance search in the EuroBonus portal.

## What To Do Now? Tips for EuroBonus Members

- **Flexibility is Key**: Be prepared to explore alternative airlines and routes, especially for award travel to Asia. Consider options like connecting through other Star Alliance members (ANA, EVA Air, Lufthansa/Swiss) or utilizing other loyalty programs. Asia is becoming particularly difficult since EuroBonus already lost Singapore and Thai, plus availability on ANA is not great.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep an eye on our blog and socials, we'll be here to keep you informed. You can also sign-up to our monthly newsletter here.
- **Start Exploring Other Options**: Consider expanding your points portfolio beyond EuroBonus. Diversifying your loyalty program memberships can provide more flexibility and options when faced with such changes.
