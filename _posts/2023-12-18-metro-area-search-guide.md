AwardFares' **Metro Area Searches** are one of the most powerful features we've ever released: it lets you search for award flights between entire regions or areas simultaneously, which is a huge time saver. Interestingly, it's also one of the most underutilized ones.

This article covers everything you should know about metro area award searches to leverage their maximum power and consistently score an award on the routes you want. Let's start!

## Understanding Metro Area Searches

Traditionally, when searching for award flights, you must specify your exact departure and arrival cities/airports. This can be limiting, especially if you're flexible with your travel plans or if award availability is scarce.

Here's an example of a traditional search [between New York and London, using AAdvantage](https://awardfares.com/search?JFK.LHR.;z:aadvantage). In this case, the departure airport is JFK, and the destination airport is Heathrow.

However, if you want to depart from New York, there are other airports, such as Newark (EWR) and La Guardia (LGA), as shown below.

If we try searching from these airports, we might find more award seats available or even at a better redemption rate. One option is to add those airports in the **Where From/Origin** field in AwardFares. Simply add EWR and LGA to the list below, as we see in the picture below:

In the result list, you'll now see flights from all these airports

However, this is cumbersome, as it forces us to know the names of the airports or cities in that area. The list can become lengthy, and we might not know other airports in the area.

Metro Area searches changes this by allowing you to search for award flights between entire regions or areas rather than specific cities. This approach broadens your search parameters, increasing your chances of finding available award seats.

## How To Use Metro Area Search

Instead of adding the airports manually, you can write the **name** of a Metropolitan area, for example, type **New York City (NYC)** for *any* airport in New York.

As you type, AwardFares' auto-suggest will clearly show you that it is a Metro Area option in the dropdown menu.

Immediately, as we zoom in, we see that searching from NYC also includes more airports and options available, such as New York Stewart International Airport.

Similarly, we can search widely on our **Destination** city. In this case, we replace LHR with **London (LON)**, which will also search award flights beyond Heathrow, including airports like Gatwick (LGW), Stansted (STN), and others.

In this example, thanks to the Metro Area search, we can find a chepear alternative (in Economy) that does not depart from JFK, saving us 25% of the points!

## Pro Tips for Mastering Metro Area Searches

* **Combine with alerts**. Set up award availability alerts for your desired route with *+-1 Day Search* enabled. This way, you'll be notified instantly when award seats open up during your three-day window, giving you a head start on booking.
* **Be flexible**. Remember, the wider your search window, the higher your chances of finding award seats. Consider expanding your date range beyond just one day before and after for even more options.
* **Play with filters**. Use filters strategically to narrow down your search results and find the award seats that perfectly match your preferences.
* **Consider Alternative Airports**. Metro Area searches might reveal availability in nearby airports that you hadn't considered.
* **Understand Your Miles**. Know the value and rules of your frequent flyer program to make the most of your miles. Some programs offer connecting flights to airports within the same metro area or region, adding extra cost to the total price in miles.

## EuroBonus: AwardFares Metro Search Is Better Than SAS

The official SAS EuroBonus website and award search portal added support for metro area searches a while back. However, you won't see all flights due to some limitations on their implementation (e.g., NYC or TYO). AwardFares in many cases is able to show you more available flights.

Here's an example from [Copenhagen (CPH) to New York City (NYC)](https://awardfares.com/search?CPH.area:NYC.;z:sas) using SAS' website, that only throws one available seat in Business Class.

However, AwardFares shows considerably more results, including 2 different Business Class flights.
