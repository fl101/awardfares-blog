From June 2024, Brussels Airlines has scheduled a new service between Brussels and Nairobi, pushing their destinations in sub-Saharan Africa to a total of 18. This isn't their first venture into the Kenyan capital; they previously operated there from 2002 to 2015. The service will feature a technical stopover in Kigali, thus bumping up the airline's Rwanda service to daily flights.

This announcement from Brussels Airlines comes along their plans to expand its long-haul fleet, adding an additional Airbus A330. As part of their 2024 summer season preparations, the airline is extending its operations in sub-Saharan Africa, its most significant market. Brussels (BRU) stands out as the primary hub for the Lufthansa Group's African ventures. 

For the warmer months, the Brussels-Nairobi route is set to operate six times weekly, scaling back to four times weekly during the winter. 

The great news is that these flights are already bookable! There are available seats using SAS EuroBonus, Aeroplan and United MileagePlus.

## 5 Reasons To Book An Award Trip With Brussels Airlines

Redeeming points or miles on Brussels Airlines can be a quite unique experience when compared to other carriers. Here are our favorite reasons:

### 1. Competitive Redemption Rates

Historically, Brussels Airlines has offered competitive redemption rates for their award flights, especially when factored against the actual cash prices of their tickets. This often means that travelers get more value per mile or point when choosing Brussels over other airlines.


### 2. Excellent Availability

One common gripe among frequent flyers is the limited seat availability for award travel on some airlines. Brussels Airlines tends to have better availability, especially in Business Class, making it easier for travelers to redeem their points on desired dates.

### 3. Quality Service and Experience

While many travelers focus solely on the monetary value of their points, the quality of the travel experience is just as important. Brussels Airlines is known for its exceptional service, especially in its Business and Premium Economy classes. Redeeming points for a higher class on Brussels Airlines can offer an enhanced travel experience that might be cost-prohibitive on other carriers.

### 4. Special Routes

Brussels Airlines offers specific routes, especially to destinations within Africa, that are not as well-served by other major carriers. For travelers looking to reach these destinations using points, Brussels Airlines might be one of the few viable options.

### 5. Strategic Geographical Position

Brussels Airlines operates out of Brussels, the capital of Belgium, which serves as a crucial European hub. The city's central location means it's a strategic transit point for those traveling between North America, Europe, and Africa. When redeeming miles for flights that connect across these continents, Brussels Airlines can often provide the most efficient routes, minimizing layovers and reducing overall travel time.
