## What Does This Mean for Travelers?

To start, the deal is expected to bring closer integration between Lufthansa and ITA Airways. ITA Airways will still maintain its brand identity, but this partnership will open up a new world of travel opportunities.

The official merger isn't expected to be complete until the end of the year, to be completed in Q4, 2024.

## ITA in a Nutshell

ITA Airways, was established in 2020 as the successor to the bankrupt Alitalia. It quickly joined the SkyTeam alliance in 2021. However, in a surprising move, it was announced that ITA Airways would leave SkyTeam and join the Star Alliance as part of the process of its acquisition by Lufthansa. Just the opposite of what is [happening with SAS after their acquisition by Air France-KLM](https://blog.awardfares.com/sas-transition-to-skyteam/).

ITA Airways is headquartered in Rome and operates its primary hub at Rome Fiumicino Airport and a secondary hub at Milan Linate Airport. The airline’s fleet consists of Airbus A320 and A350.
