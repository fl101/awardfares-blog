### Booking in First Class {#first}

To book a first class seat on Singapore Airlines using points, you'll have to use the airline's own frequent flyer program, KrisFlyer. Unfortunately, it is not possible to book Suites or first class with any other award programs.

### Singapore Airlines and SAS EuroBonus {#eurobonus}

Singapore Airlines is an SAS EuroBonus partner, but it was never really possible to book seats on SQ using EuroBonus points. During a brief moment in 2022, it was possible to search for awards on SAS website, but after a few days, they disabled it.

As of 2023, SAS has removed the text mentioning "technical issues" from its website. However, it is still not possible to book Singapore Airlines awards using EuroBonus points.
