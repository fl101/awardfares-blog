## EVA Air Business Class Differences By Aircraft {#biz}

EVA Air offers two types of business class cabins: *Royal Laurel Class* and *Premium Laurel Class/Business Class*. Depending on the aircraft type, the cabin, seat, and configurations are different. For example, The Royal Laurel Class on the 787s are much newer and more private than on the 777-300. Here's a quick recap.

### Boeing 777-300ER

Royal Laurel Class: EVA's primary long-haul Business Class product is found on the majority of its 777-300ERs.

* Seat Configuration: Reverse herringbone, 1-2-1, ensuring direct aisle access for all seats.
* Seats recline to a fully-flat bed.
* Each seat features a large entertainment screen, ample storage, and USB/power outlets.

### Boeing 787 Dreamliner (787-9 and 787-10)

A newer addition to EVA's fleet, the Dreamliners feature updated Royal Laurel Class seats.

* Seat Configuration: Reverse herringbone, 1-2-1 layout similar to the 777-300ER.
* The design, however, is slightly more modern and has enhancements based on the newer aircraft’s features. 
* Features a fully-flat bed, large entertainment screens, and ample storage.

### Airbus A330-200/300

Premium Laurel Class: Before the introduction of Royal Laurel on the 777-300ER, Premium Laurel was EVA's top business class product.

* Seat Configuration: 2-2-2, meaning not all seats have direct aisle access.
* These seats are angle-flat, not fully flat, making them less ideal for long-haul travel.
* The entertainment system and other amenities might seem slightly dated compared to the newer Royal Laurel seats on the 777 and 787.
