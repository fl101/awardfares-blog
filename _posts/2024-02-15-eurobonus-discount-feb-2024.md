If you are a SAS Mastercard cardholder and have the Fly Premium benefit, it's also possible to combine this benefit with the point discount, as seen in the image above.

Also, remember that there most destinations don't have available seats over Easter 2024 (March 28 to April 1).

### 1. [Visby, Sweden](https://awardfares.com/search?country:SE.VBY.;a:SK;z:sas)

Several seats available from many cities in Sweden, including Stockholm.
