Some exciting news from EVA Air, who have announced they will be launching a brand new route connecting Taipei and Munich. The Milano route is now also officially resuming after being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Both routes are ideally for onward travel within Asia since the inbound flight into Taipei arrive early in the morning. They will be operated by EVA Air's Boeing 777-300ER featuring the Royal Laurel (1-2-1) business class cabin.

EVA Air is one of the best business products that I've flown, with great service and excellent food & beverages.
