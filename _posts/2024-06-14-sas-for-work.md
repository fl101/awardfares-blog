Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is revamping its business travel program, SAS for Business, with a new name and a focus on making business trips smoother for both employees and companies. The program will now be known as **SAS for Work**, and it launches with a myriad of new benefits starting June 11th.

## Enhanced Travel Experience for Business Travelers

Business travelers enrolled in SAS for Work will enjoy a more convenient travel experience. The program now includes free name changes and free seat selection in SAS Business and SAS Plus cabins. This allows for greater flexibility and control over bookings.

"We understand the importance of face-to-face meetings for business success," says Paul Verhagen, Chief Commercial Officer at SAS. "Our goal with SAS for Work is to make the travel experience easier and more seamless for both the traveler and the company."
