Copying/exporting journeys has been available in AwardFares for a long time. To do so, simply click "Copy" and you'll receive a text description of your journey:

```
Route	Flight	Date	Depart	Arrive
FRA-BKK	TG921	2019-09-19	14:45	06:25 (+1)
BKK-HND	TG660	2019-09-20	13:00	21:10 
```

Now, it is also possible to paste/import a journey back into AwardFares. This is useful if you, for example, want to share a journey with someone else or move your journey to a different browser/computer.

To import a copied journey, simply click anywhere on the page and then hit `ctrl+v` (windows) or `cmd+v` (mac) and your journey should automatically show up!
