We're thrilled to announce a major update to AwardFares that makes finding the perfect seat on your award flight easier than ever before! Our improved [**Seat Maps**](https://awardfares.com/seats) feature now offers detailed seat availability for flights operated by:

* [American Airlines](https://www.aa.com/)
* [British Airways](https://www.britishairways.com/)
* [Delta Air Lines](https://www.delta.com/)

This means you can now visualize the cabin layout, check legroom for different seats, and strategically choose your seat based on your preferences – all directly within AwardFares.

* See all available flights for your desired route and dates
* Easily compare fares and award availability across different airlines
* Seamlessly switch between finding the perfect award seat and viewing the flight schedule
