Turkish Airlines has officially announced its inaugural flights to Australia, beginning on March 15 with a thrice-weekly service from Istanbul to Melbourne, via Singapore Changi Airport. The initial flights will utilize Boeing 787-9 aircraft, transitioning to Airbus A350-900 from March 31.

Turkish Airlines cabins on the 787 and A350 are among the most modern in the industry, particularly in Business Class. These flights are a fantastic opportunity to fly a long route with great service.

This launch marks Melbourne as Turkish Airlines' first Australian destination and adds it as the 346th point in its expansive network. The airline aims to increase its presence in Australia in the coming years by boosting flight frequencies and destinations.

The flights to Melbourne Airport (MEL) will offer a brief layover in Singapore, and Turkish Airlines will be the only European carrier on this route. This development is particularly significant for Melbourne, which hosts Australia's largest Turkish community.

## Award Availability

As of today, awards seem to be available from the inaugural date, March 15th using several frequent flyer programs, including SAS EuroBonus and United MileagePlus.

Keep in mind that availability differs between the programs, and, seats in premium cabins, such as Business Class, is more scarce than in Economy.

Here's the availability up to date using SAS EuroBonus points:

In the long term, Turkish Airlines intends to operate nonstop flights between Istanbul and Australia, contingent on acquiring suitable long-haul aircraft like the Airbus A350-1000 or the Boeing 777X.
