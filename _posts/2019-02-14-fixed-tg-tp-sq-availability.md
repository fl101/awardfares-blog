Over the past couple of weeks we've been having issues fetching availability data for Thai Airways, Singapore Airlines, and TAP. However, after some hard work, this is finally back. There are some limitations though described below.

Awards are now available for Thai Airways, Singapore Airlines, and TAP for routes to/from the following airports: BKK, BKT, LIS, OPO, and SIN. Note that Singapore First Class availability is currently not displayed for most routes, including CPH-SIN, ARN-SIN.

~~Singapore Airlines availability is not available for CPH-SIN and ARN-SIN at the moment. This will most likely come back soon though. Some other Singapore Airlines routes may not be available either, for example, SIN-EWR.~~

~~Singapore Airlines availability in Business and First Class is currently only available for a subset of aircraft types (including Airbus A330 and Boeing 737). Other aircrafts, such as 777, 77W, and A380 are not available at the moment.~~
