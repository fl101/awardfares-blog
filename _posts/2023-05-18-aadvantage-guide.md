## What is [AAdvantage](https://awardfares.com/search?..;z:aadvantage)?

AAdvantage is the frequent flyer program of American Airlines. It is one of the oldest and most popular frequent flyer programs in the world. AAdvantage members earn miles for flying on American Airlines and its partner airlines, as well as for using AAdvantage credit cards, making purchases with AAdvantage partners, and completing other activities. Miles can be redeemed for flights, upgrades, hotel stays, rental cars, and other rewards.


### Why AAdvantage? (AAdvantage vs. other frequent flyer programs)

AAdvantage is heavily North America-centric, but there are many reasons why you might choose AAdvantage over other frequent flyer programs in general, no matter where you are located. 

Here are a few of the most important ones. **Spoiler alert:** the [AAdvantage shopping portal](https://www.aadvantageeshopping.com/) and the possibility to [upgrade status through purchases](https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/aadvantage-status/aadvantage-status.jsp) are some of our favorite ones at AwardFares.

* **A huge network of partners**. AAdvantage is a member of the OneWorld alliance, which gives you access to a wide range of airlines and destinations. You can earn and redeem miles on American Airlines, as well as on other OneWorld airlines like British Airways, Cathay Pacific, and Qantas.
* **Many ways to earn miles**. You can earn AAdvantage miles for flying on American Airlines and its partner airlines, as well as for using AAdvantage credit cards, making purchases with AAdvantage partners, and completing other activities. This makes it easy to earn miles even if you don't fly very often.
* **Flexibility to redeem miles**. You can redeem AAdvantage miles for flights, upgrades, hotel stays, rental cars, and other rewards. This gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to using your miles.
* **Elite status levels**. AAdvantage offers a variety of elite status levels, each with its own set of benefits. This means that you can earn more benefits as you fly more often.
* **A good customer service reputation**. AAdvantage has a good reputation for customer service.

## AAdvantage Award Chart (Updated)


### On American Airlines

American Airlines AAdvantage award chart was simplified in April 2023, with the number of award zones reduced from 10 to 4. The new award chart is dynamic, meaning that the number of miles required to book an award flight can vary depending on the time of year, the day of the week, and the availability of seats.

The new award chart is as follows:

* [North America](https://awardfares.com/search?continent:NA.continent:NA.;a:AA;z:aadvantage)
    * 7,500 miles for a one-way award in economy
    * 12,500 miles for a one-way award in business class
    * 22,500 miles for a one-way award in first class
* [Latin America and the Caribbean](https://awardfares.com/search?continent:NA.continent:SA.;a:AA;z:aadvantage)
    * 12,500 miles for a one-way award in economy
    * 17,500 miles for a one-way award in business class
    * 27,500 miles for a one-way award in first class
* [Europe](https://awardfares.com/search?continent:NA.continent:EU.;a:AA;z:aadvantage)
    * 15,000 miles for a one-way award in economy
    * 20,000 miles for a one-way award in business class
    * 30,000 miles for a one-way award in first class
* [Asia](https://awardfares.com/search?continent:NA.continent:AS.;a:AA;z:aadvantage), [Africa](https://awardfares.com/search?continent:NA.continent:AF.;a:AA;z:aadvantage), and [Oceania](https://awardfares.com/search?continent:NA.continent:OC.;a:AA;z:aadvantage)
    * 20,000 miles for a one-way award in economy
    * 25,000 miles for a one-way award in business class
    * 35,000 miles for a one-way award in first class

There are a few exceptions to the above award prices. For example, awards to Hawaii start at 12,500 miles in economy, and awards to Alaska start at 15,000 miles in economy.

Award prices can also vary depending on the time of year. For example, awards to Europe are typically more expensive during the peak travel season (June through August).
